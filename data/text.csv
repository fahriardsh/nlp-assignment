Key facts
"Affordable, effective and feasible strategies exist to promote, protect and restore mental health."
The need for action on mental health is indisputable and urgent.
Mental health has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.
"Mental health is determined by a complex interplay of individual, social and structural stresses and vulnerabilities."
Concepts in mental health
""
"Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community."
"It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in."
Mental health is a basic human right.
"And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development."
Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders.
"It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes."
"Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm."
"People with mental health conditions are more likely to experience lower levels of mental well-being, but this is not always or necessarily the case."
Determinants of mental health
"Throughout our lives, multiple individual, social and structural determinants may combine to protect or undermine our mental health and shift our position on the mental health continuum."
"Individual psychological and biological factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can make people more vulnerable to mental health problems."
"Exposure to unfavourable social, economic, geopolitical and environmental circumstances – including poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation – also increases people’s risk of experiencing mental health conditions."
"Risks can manifest themselves at all stages of life, but those that occur during developmentally sensitive periods, especially early childhood, are particularly detrimental."
"For example, harsh parenting and physical punishment is known to undermine child health and bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions."
Protective factors similarly occur throughout our lives and serve to strengthen resilience.
"They include our individual social and emotional skills and attributes as well as positive social interactions, quality education, decent work, safe neighbourhoods and community cohesion, among others."
Mental health risks and protective factors can be found in society at different scales.
"Local threats heighten risk for individuals, families and communities."
"Global threats heighten risk for whole populations and include economic downturns, disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies and forced displacement and the growing climate crisis."
Each single risk and protective factor has only limited predictive strength.
Most people do not develop a mental health condition despite exposure to a risk factor and many people with no known risk factor still develop a mental health condition.
"Nonetheless, the interacting determinants of mental health serve to enhance or undermine mental health."
Mental health promotion and prevention
"Promotion and prevention interventions work by identifying the individual, social and structural determinants of mental health, and then intervening to reduce risks, build resilience and establish supportive environments for mental health."
"Interventions can be designed for individuals, specific groups or whole populations."
"Reshaping the determinants of mental health often requires action beyond the health sector and so promotion and prevention programmes should involve the education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors."
"The health sector can contribute significantly by embedding promotion and prevention efforts within health services; and by advocating, initiating and, where appropriate, facilitating multisectoral collaboration and coordination."
Suicide prevention is a global priority and included in the Sustainable Development Goals.
"Much progress can be achieved by limiting access to means, responsible media reporting, social and emotional learning for adolescents and early intervention."
Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly inexpensive and cost–effective intervention for reducing suicide rates.
"Promoting child and adolescent mental health is another priority and can be achieved by policies and laws that promote and protect mental health, supporting caregivers to provide nurturing care, implementing school-based programmes and improving the quality of community and online environments."
School-based social and emotional learning programmes are among the most effective promotion strategies for countries at all income levels.
"Promoting and protecting mental health at work is a growing area of interest and can be supported through legislation and regulation, organizational strategies, manager training and interventions for workers."
Mental health care and treatment
"In the context of national efforts to strengthen mental health, it is vital to not only protect and promote the mental well-being of all, but also to address the needs of people with mental health conditions."
"This should be done through community-based mental health care, which is more accessible and acceptable than institutional care, helps prevent human rights violations and delivers better recovery outcomes for people with mental health conditions."
Community-based mental health care should be provided through a network of interrelated services that comprise:
""
"mental health services that are integrated in general health care, typically in general hospitals and through task-sharing with non-specialist care providers in primary health care;"
"community mental health services that may involve community mental health centers and teams, psychosocial rehabilitation, peer support services and supported living services; and"
"services that deliver mental health care in social services and non-health settings, such as child protection, school health services, and prisons."
"The vast care gap for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety means countries must also find innovative ways to diversify and scale up care for these conditions, for example through non-specialist psychological counselling or digital self-help."
WHO response
"All WHO Member States are committed to implementing the “Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030"", which aims to improve mental health by strengthening effective leadership and governance, providing comprehensive, integrated and responsive community-based care, implementing promotion and prevention strategies, and strengthening information systems, evidence and research."
"In 2020, WHO’s “Mental health atlas 2020” analysis of country performance against the action plan showed insufficient advances against the targets of the agreed action plan."
WHO’s “World mental health report: transforming mental health for all” calls on all countries to accelerate implementation of the action plan.
It argues that all countries can achieve meaningful progress towards better mental health for their populations by focusing on three “paths to transformation”:
""
"deepen the value given to mental health by individuals, communities and governments; and matching that value with commitment, engagement and investment by all stakeholders, across all sectors;"
"reshape the physical, social and economic characteristics of environments – in homes, schools, workplaces and the wider community – to better protect mental health and prevent mental health conditions; and"
"strengthen mental health care so that the full spectrum of mental health needs is met through a community-based network of accessible, affordable and quality services and supports."
"WHO gives particular emphasis to protecting and promoting human rights, empowering people with lived experience and ensuring a multisectoral and multistakeholder approach."
"WHO continues to work nationally and internationally – including in humanitarian settings – to provide governments and partners with the strategic leadership, evidence, tools and technical support to strengthen a collective response to mental health and enable a transformation towards better mental health for all."
Key facts
There were an estimated 272 million international migrants in 2019 (1).
"Refugees, asylum seekers and irregular migrants are of special concern and need protection and support."
Migrants and refugees can be exposed to various stress factors which affect their mental health and well-being before and during their migration journey and during their settlement and integration.
"The prevalence of common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) tends to be higher among migrants exposed to adversity and refugees than among host populations."
Many migrants and refugees lack access to mental health services or experience barriers in accessing these.
They also face disruptions in continuity of care.
"The mental health needs of migrants and refugees should be addressed by organizing inclusive and accessible promotion and prevention programmes; strengthening mental health as part of general health services; and ensuring timely diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation."
"Migrants and refugees contribute positively to society, but they cannot reach their full potential unless they are in good physical and mental health."
Problems and stressors facing migrants and refugees 
Migrants and refugees often face various problems and stressors which can take place at various stages of the migration process: 
""
"Pre-migration: lack of livelihoods and opportunities for education and development, exposure to armed conflict, violence, poverty and/or persecution."
Migration travel and transit: exposure to challenging and life-threatening conditions including violence and detention and lack of access to services to cover their basic needs.
"Post-migration: barriers to accessing health care and other services to meet their basic needs as well as poor living conditions, separation from family members and support networks, possible uncertainty regarding work permits and legal status (asylum application), and in some cases immigration detention."
"Integration and settlement: poor living or working conditions, unemployment, assimilation difficulties, challenges to cultural, religious, and gender identities, challenges with obtaining entitlements, changing policies in host countries, racism and exclusion, tension between host population and migrants and refugees, social isolation and possible deportation."
Risk and protective factors for mental health conditions
All of the above-mentioned stressors can increase the risk of developing mental health conditions.
"For example, unemployment, poor socioeconomic conditions, and lack of social integration among migrants and refugees are risk factors for mental health conditions such as depression."
"At the same time, these stressors can also exacerbate pre-existing social and mental health problems."
"Factors that negatively impact the mental health and well-being of migrant and refugee children include socioeconomic deprivation, discrimination, racism, low family cohesion, and frequent school changes."
"Children who have been separated from migrating parents are at heightened risk of developing depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, conduct disorder, and substance use problems."
"On the other hand, the impact of stressors can be buffered by protective factors such as access to employment and services, social support, proficiency in the language of the host country, and family reunification."
"Among resettled refugee children, protective factors include better socioeconomic status, access to education, a perceived sense of safety, contacts with family, living and socialising alongside other people of the same ethnic origin, a stable and cohesive family structure and good parental mental health."
Prevalence of mental health conditions
Many migrants and refugees will experience distress (e.g.
"feelings of anxiety and sadness, hopelessness, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, irritability, anger and/or aches and pains)."
"For most people, these reactions will improve over time."
Some studies show that the prevalence of common mental disorders (e.g.
"depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) is higher among migrants and refugees than among host populations."
Asylum seekers tend to be at elevated risk of suicide.
"There is also consistent evidence that the incidence of psychoses is higher among migrant populations in a number of countries, and this has been linked with the cumulative effect of social disadvantages before, during and after migration."
Responding to the mental health needs of migrants and refugees
"A comprehensive, multi-disciplinary and inclusive approach is needed to address the mental health needs of migrants and refugees."
Overcoming barriers to receiving mental health care
""
Addressing barriers to receiving mental health care should include:
""
provision of clear information on mental health care entitlements and how to receive services (e.g.
"through reception centers, community outreach, schools, religious or cultural settings);"
outreach to at-risk groups (e.g.
"unaccompanied minors, persons with disabilities, persons who identify as LGBTIQ+);"
"facilitation of affordable and non-discriminatory access to care regardless of legal status, ensuring financial coverage of mental health services and care provided;"
facilitation of communication (e.g.
through engaging interpreters and cultural mediators);
providing person-centred care that is respectful of cultural differences; and
facilitating the engagement of multiple sectors and systems (e.g.
"law enforcement, protection, social services and education) to integrate mental health considerations and support and ensure referral and access to mental health services."
Integrating mental health in primary health care
""
Making mental health care available through general health care can help identify migrants and refugees with mental health conditions and can make care more accessible and cost effective (e.g.
see WHO mhGAP intervention guides mhGAP-HIG and mhGAP-IG).
The delivery of interventions may require adaptation to migrant and refugee populations to take into account language and cultural considerations.
Interventions provided should be consistent with the national guidelines and policies on mental health of the host country.
Ensuring continuity of care
""
"When providing mental health care, an important consideration is related to the length of stay of the migrant or refugee in the host country."
"The continuity and quality of mental health care of migrants and refugees on the move can be improved by creating international protocols for assuring continuity of care, improving communication among different social and mental health service providers and providing key written information tailored to their needs that migrants and refugees can take with them and share with different providers."
Addressing social determinants and promoting social integration and inclusion
""
Migration management policies and provision that have proved to have a negative effect on the mental well-being of migrants (e.g.
separation of families and children) should be avoided.
"The social integration of migrants and refugees can be facilitated by equal access to employment opportunities and decent work, vocational training, financial support, social protection services, and legal and law enforcement agencies, as well as mental health care and psychosocial support."
The recognition of skills and qualifications acquired pre-migration can also help their integration into the employment sector.
Activities and events that promote the social inclusion of migrants and refugees include community forums or peer-mentorship programmes organized by members of the same refugee or migrant group who are already well-integrated into the local community.
Special attention is required to support asylum seekers.
WHO response
WHO is the lead International agency in providing technical advice on mental health.
"WHO developed a Global Action Plan (2019-2023) to promote the health of migrants and refugees, approved by the World Health Assembly in May 2019."
The Global Action Plan describes overarching priorities and guiding principles to promote the health of migrants and refugees and to contribute to achieving the aim of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development – to leave no one behind.
The Global Action Plan highlights how the many barriers that migrants and refugees experience in accessing health-care services can precipitate negative mental health outcomes.
"The plan recommends priorities and options for action by the Secretariat in coordination and collaboration with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other relevant partners."
"In May 2021, the World Health Assembly endorsed an update of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (2013-2030), with the overall goal to promote mental well-being, prevent mental disorders, provide care, enhance recovery, promote human rights and reduce the mortality, morbidity and disability of persons with mental disorders."
"WHO is committed to supporting Member States in promoting the physical and mental health of migrants and refugees by strengthening health care services, as appropriate and acceptable to country contexts and financial situations, and in line with their national priorities and legal frameworks and competence."
"WHO is also committed to ensuring that essential components are addressed, including the provision of treatment and care for mental and behavioural disorders."
"In line with the Global Action Plan, WHO is operational on mental health in a range of countries and territories that host large numbers of migrants and refugees."
"These include Bangladesh, Colombia, Pakistan, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan, South Sudan, Sudan, Turkey and Uganda."
"WHO has close working relationship with other UN partners, including IOM and UNHCR to meet the mental health needs of migrants and refugees."
WHO co-chairs the Inter-Agency Standing Committee Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings that provides advice and support to organizations working in emergencies and helps ensure that the mental health response is coordinated and effective.
Emergency situations often cause displacement and may lead to people becoming refugees or internally displaced.
WHO’s advice and tools are used by most large international humanitarian organizations active in mental health.
"WHO and partners have published a range of practical tools and guidelines to meet the mental health needs of people affected by emergencies, including migrants and refugees."
Key facts
1 in every 8 people in the world live with a mental disorder
"Mental disorders involve significant disturbances in thinking, emotional regulation, or behaviour"
There are many different types of mental disorders
Effective prevention and treatment options exist
Most people do not have access to effective care
"A mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour."
It is usually associated with distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.
There are many different types of mental disorders.
Mental disorders may also be referred to as mental health conditions.
"The latter is a broader term covering mental disorders, psychosocial disabilities and (other) mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm."
This fact sheet focuses on mental disorders as described by the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11).
"In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common (1)."
"In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic."
Initial estimates show a 26% and 28% increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in just one year (2).
"While effective prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care."
"Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights."
Anxiety Disorders
"In 2019, 301 million people were living with an anxiety disorder including 58 million children and adolescents (1)."
Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related behavioural disturbances.
Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant distress or significant impairment in functioning.
"There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, such as: generalised anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive worry), panic disorder (characterised by panic attacks), social anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear and worry in social situations), separation anxiety disorder (characterised by excessive fear or anxiety about separation from those individuals to whom the person has a deep emotional bond), and others."
"Effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered."
Depression
"In 2019, 280 million people were living with depression, including 23 million children and adolescents (1)."
Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life.
"During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks."
"Several other symptoms are also present, which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying or suicide, disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling especially tired or low in energy."
People with depression are at an increased risk of suicide.
"Yet, effective psychological treatment exists, and depending on the age and severity, medication may also be considered."
Bipolar Disorder
"In 2019, 40 million people experienced bipolar disorder (1)."
People with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with periods of manic symptoms.
"During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly every day."
"Manic symptoms may include euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour."
People with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk of suicide.
"Yet effective treatment options exist including psychoeducation, reduction of stress and strengthening of social functioning, and medication."
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
The prevalence of PTSD and other mental disorders is high in conflict-affected settings (3).
PTSD may develop following exposure to an extremely threatening or horrific event or series of events.
"It is characterised by all of the following: 1) re-experiencing the traumatic event or events in the present (intrusive memories, flashbacks, or nightmares); 2) avoidance of thoughts and memories of the event(s), or avoidance of activities, situations, or people reminiscent of the event(s); and 3) persistent perceptions of heightened current threat."
These symptoms persist for at least several weeks and cause significant impairment in functioning.
Effective psychological treatment exists.
Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people worldwide (1).
People with schizophrenia have a life expectancy 10-20 years below that of the general population (4).
Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in perception and changes in behaviour.
"Symptoms may include persistent delusions, hallucinations, disorganised thinking, highly disorganised behaviour, or extreme agitation."
People with schizophrenia may experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive functioning.
"Yet, a range of effective treatment options exist, including medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, and psychosocial rehabilitation."
Eating Disorders
"In 2019, 14 million people experienced eating disorders including almost 3 million children and adolescents (1)."
"Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, involve abnormal eating and preoccupation with food as well as prominent body weight and shape concerns."
"The symptoms or behaviours result in significant risk or damage to health, significant distress, or significant impairment of functioning."
Anorexia nervosa often has its onset during adolescence or early adulthood and is associated with premature death due to medical complications or suicide.
"Individuals with bulimia nervosa are at a significantly increased risk for substance use, suicidality, and health complications."
"Effective treatment options exist, including family-based treatment and cognitive-based therapy."
Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders
"40 million people, including children and adolescents, were living with conduct-dissocial disorder in 2019 (1)."
"This disorder, also known as conduct disorder, is one of two disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, the other is oppositional defiant disorder."
"Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders are characterised by persistent behaviour problems such as persistently defiant or disobedient to behaviours that persistently violate the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms, rules, or laws."
"Onset of disruptive and dissocial disorders, is commonly, though not always, during childhood."
"Effective psychological treatments exist, often involving parents, caregivers, and teachers, cognitive problem-solving or social skills training."
Neurodevelopmental disorders
"Neurodevelopmental disorders are behavioural and cognitive disorders, that?"
"arise during the developmental period, and involve significant difficulties in the acquisition and execution of specific intellectual, motor, language, or social functions."
"Neurodevelopmental disorders include disorders of intellectual development, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) amongst others."
"ADHD is characterised by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that has a direct negative impact on academic, occupational, or social functioning."
"Disorders of intellectual development are characterised by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behaviour, which refers to difficulties with everyday conceptual, social, and practical skills that are performed in daily life."
"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitutes a diverse group of conditions characterised by some degree of difficulty with social communication and reciprocal social interaction, as well as persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities."
"Effective treatment options exist including psychosocial interventions, behavioural interventions, occupational and speech therapy."
"For certain diagnoses and age groups, medication may also be considered."
Who is at risk from developing a mental disorder?
"At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community, and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health."
"Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances – including poverty, violence, disability, and inequality – are at higher risk."
"Protective and risk factors include individual psychological and biological factors, such as emotional skills as well as genetics."
Many of the risk and protective factors are influenced through changes in brain structure and/or function.
Health systems and social support
Health systems have not yet adequately responded to the needs of people with mental disorders and are significantly under resourced.
The gap between the need for treatment and its provision is wide all over the world; and is often poor in quality when delivered.
"For example, only 29% of people with psychosis (5) and only one third of people with depression receive formal mental health care (6)."
"People with mental disorders also require social support, including support in developing and maintaining personal, family, and social relationships."
"People with mental disorders may also need support for educational programmes, employment, housing, and participation in other meaningful activities."
WHO response
WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 recognizes the essential role of mental health in achieving health for all people.
The plan includes 4 major objectives:
""
to strengthen effective leadership and governance for mental health;
"to provide comprehensive, integrated and responsive mental health and social care services in community-based settings;"
to implement of strategies for promotion and prevention in mental health; and
"to strengthen information systems, evidence, and research for mental health."
"WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) uses evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to expand services in countries, especially in resource-poor settings."
"It focuses on a prioritized set of conditions, directing capacity building towards non-specialized health-care providers in an integrated approach that promotes mental health at all levels of care."
"The WHO mhGAP Intervention Guide 2.0 is part of this Programme, and provides guidance for doctors, nurses, and other health workers in non-specialist health settings on assessment and management of mental disorders."
Key facts
"Anxiety disorders are the world’s most common mental disorders, affecting 301 million people in 2019."
More women are affected by anxiety disorders than men.
Symptoms of anxiety often have onset during childhood or adolescence.
There are highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders.
Approximately 1 in 4 people with anxiety disorders receive treatment for this condition.
Overview
"Everyone can feel anxious sometimes, but people with anxiety disorders often experience fear and worry that is both intense and excessive."
These feelings are typically accompanied by physical tension and other behavioural and cognitive symptoms.
"They are difficult to control, cause significant distress and can last a long time if untreated."
"Anxiety disorders interfere with daily activities and can impair a person’s family, social and school or working life."
An estimated 4% of the global population currently experience an anxiety disorder (1).
"In 2019, 301 million people in the world had an anxiety disorder, making anxiety disorders the most common of all mental disorders (1)."
"Although highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders exist, only about 1 in 4 people in need (27.6%) receive any treatment (2)."
"Barriers to care include lack of awareness that this is a treatable health condition, lack of investment in mental health services, lack of trained health care providers, and social stigma."
Symptoms and patterns
"People with an anxiety disorder may experience excessive fear or worry about a specific situation (for example, a panic attack or social situation) or, in the case of generalized anxiety disorder, about a broad range of everyday situations."
They typically experience these symptoms over an extended period – at least several months.
Usually they avoid the situations that make them anxious.
Other symptoms of anxiety disorders may include:
""
trouble concentrating or making decisions
"feeling irritable, tense or restless"
experiencing nausea or abdominal distress
having heart palpitations
"sweating, trembling or shaking"
trouble sleeping
"having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom."
Anxiety disorders increase the risk for depression and substance use disorders as well as the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.
"There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, including:"
""
generalized anxiety disorder (persistent and excessive worry about daily activities or events);
panic disorder (panic attacks and fear of continued panic attacks);
"social anxiety disorder (high levels of fear and worry about social situations that might make the person feel humiliated, embarrassed or rejected);"
"agoraphobia (excessive fear, worry and avoidance of situations that might cause a person to panic or feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed);"
separation anxiety disorder (excessive fear or worry about being separated from people with whom the person has a deep emotional bond);
"specific phobias (intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations that lead to avoidance behaviour and significant distress); and"
"selective mutism (consistent inability to speak in certain social situations, despite the ability to speak comfortably in other settings, primarily affecting children)."
People may experience more than one anxiety disorder at the same time.
Symptoms often begin during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood.
Girls and women are more likely to experience an anxiety disorder than boys and men.
Contributing factors and prevention
"Anxiety disorders, like other mental health conditions, result from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors."
"Anyone can have an anxiety disorder, but people who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse experiences are more likely to develop one."
Anxiety disorders are closely related to and affected by physical health.
"Many of the impacts of anxiety (such as physical tension, nervous system hyperactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease."
"In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing anxiety disorders due to the difficulties associated with managing their conditions."
Effective community based approaches to prevent anxiety include parental education and school-based programmes to enhance social and emotional learning and build positive coping in children and adolescents.
Exercise programmes can also be effective in preventing anxiety disorders in adults.
Diagnosis and treatment
There are several effective treatments for anxiety disorders.
People with symptoms of anxiety should seek care.
Psychological interventions are essential treatments for anxiety disorders and refer primarily to talk therapy with professionals or supervised lay therapists.
"These interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking, coping or relating to their anxiety, to others or to the world."
"They can teach people how to face the situations, events, people or places that trigger their anxiety."
"Psychological interventions can be provided to individuals or groups, in person or online."
"They may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps."
The psychological interventions with the most evidence for treating a range of anxiety disorders are those based on principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy.
"These include exposure therapy, during which people learn to face their fears."
"In addition, learning stress management skills, such as relaxation skills and mindfulness skills, can help reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders."
"Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be useful in treating adults with anxiety disorders."
"Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences."
"Benzodiazepines, which have historically been prescribed for anxiety disorders, are generally not recommended for anxiety disorders because of their high potential for dependence as well as their limited long-term effectiveness."
Self-care
Self-care can play an important role in supporting treatment.
"To help manage your symptoms of anxiety and promote your overall well-being, you can:"
""
"avoid or cut down on alcohol and don’t use illicit drugs, which can make anxiety worse;"
"exercise regularly, even if it’s just a short walk;"
stick to regular eating and sleeping habits as much as possible and eat a healthy diet;
"learn relaxation techniques, such as slow breathing and progressive muscle relaxation; and"
"develop the habit of mindfulness meditation, even if it’s just a few minutes per day."
WHO response
"WHO’s Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders."
Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are included in the priority conditions covered by WHO’s mhGAP Programme.
"This programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health."
WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups.
"These interventions have been shown to be effective for multiple mental health problems, including anxiety and depression."
"An example is the Problem management plus (PM+) manual, which is based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy and uses techniques like stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support."
"Additionally, the Self-Help Plus (SH+) group-based stress management course and WHO’s popular Doing What Matters in Times of Stress self-help book describe skills that can be used to reduce anxiety and stress."
Key facts
"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that affects a person’s mood, energy, activity and thought and is characterized by manic (or hypomanic) and depressive episodes."
An estimated 40 million people live with bipolar disorder worldwide.
Bipolar disorder is associated with significant disability and difficulties in many areas of life.
Many people with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed or untreated and experience discrimination and stigma.
"There are a range of effective care options, which combine medicines and psychosocial interventions to help people with bipolar disorder stay well."
Overview
"In 2019, approximately 1 in 150 adults (40 million people, or 0.53% of the global population) were living with bipolar disorder (1)."
"The condition is primarily observed among working-age people, but also in youth."
"While the prevalence of bipolar disorder among men and women is approximately equal, available data indicate that women are more often diagnosed."
"Worldwide, the treatment coverage for people with bipolar disorder is low."
Both men and women are often misdiagnosed.
"Many lack access to services and recommended interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)."
"Stigma and discrimination against people with bipolar disorder are widespread, both in communities and health services."
This can undermine access to health care.
"It also fuels social exclusion and can limit opportunities for education, employment and housing."
Bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability globally as it can affect many areas of life.
"People with bipolar disorder may experience strained relationships, problems at school or work, and difficulties in carrying out daily activities."
Having bipolar disorder also increases the risk of suicide and of developing anxiety and substance use disorders.
"People with bipolar disorder are more likely to smoke, use alcohol, have a physical health condition (e.g."
"cardiovascular or respiratory disease), and experience difficulties in accessing health care."
"On average, people with bipolar disorder die more than 10 years earlier than the general population (2)."
Symptoms and patterns
Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by mood swings from one extreme to another.
"During a manic episode, a person experiences an extremely high mood with lots of energy (feeling very happy, excited, overactive)."
"They may have a sense of euphoria, sudden shifts in mood or an excess of emotion (uncontrollable laughing or feeling much more irritable, agitated or restless than usual)."
"In manic episodes, the changes in mood and activities are accompanied by other characteristic symptoms, which may include:"
""
highly inflated sense of self-worth or self-esteem;
talking quickly and rapidly shifting from one idea to the next;
having trouble concentrating and being easily distracted;
decreased need for sleep;
"reckless or risk-taking behaviour, for example overspending, risky sexual activity, drinking, or harming oneself or others; and"
fixed and mistaken grandiose or persecutory beliefs in something untrue (e.g.
"“I am a very famous person”, “My neighbour is spying on me”)."
"On the contrary, during a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty)."
They may feel a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that they had previously enjoyed.
"Other symptoms are also present, which may include:"

"A depressive episode is different from mood fluctuations commonly experienced by most people, in that the symptoms last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks."
"Both manic and depressive episodes can cause significant difficulties in all aspects of life, including at home, work and school."
They may require specialized care to prevent the person from doing harm to themselves or others.
Some people with bipolar disorder may experience what are called hypomanic episodes.
"Hypomanic episodes involve similar symptoms to manic episodes, but the symptoms are less intense and do not typically disrupt the person’s ability to function to the same extent."
"There are two main types of bipolar disorder, depending on patterns of manic or hypomanic and depressive episodes."
People with bipolar type I disorder experience one or more manic episodes interspaced with episodes of depression which usually become more common over time (compared with manic episodes).
"People with bipolar type II disorder have had one or more hypomanic episodes and at least one depressive episode, but no history of manic episodes."
Risks and protective factors
The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown.
Several factors – including biological (e.g.
"genetic), psychological, social and structural factors – may contribute to its onset, trajectory and outcomes."
Adverse circumstances or life-altering events can trigger or exacerbate the symptoms of bipolar disorder.
"These may include bereavement, violence or the breakdown of a relationship."
The use of alcohol or drugs can also influence the onset and trajectory of bipolar disorder.
"Although employment can be a source of stress for people living with bipolar disorder, it can also be protective."
"Under good working conditions, and when supported at their workplace with reasonable adjustments, employment can promote recovery by improving functioning, reducing symptoms and leading to a higher quality of life and improved self-esteem."
Treatment and care
"Even though symptoms often recur, recovery is possible."
"With appropriate care, people with bipolar disorder can cope with their symptoms and live meaningful and productive lives."
"There are a range of effective treatment options, typically a mix of medicines and psychological and psychosocial interventions."
"Medicines are considered essential for treatment, but themselves are usually insufficient to achieve full recovery."
"People with bipolar disorder should be treated with respect and dignity and should be meaningfully involved in care choices, including through shared decision-making regarding treatment and care, balancing effectiveness, side-effects and individual preferences."
Medicines
"People with bipolar disorder need treatment and care across acute episodes of mania and depression and when indicated, longer-term treatment to prevent relapse."
"Mood stabilizers (such as lithium, valproate) and antipsychotics are proven to help manage acute mania."
Lithium prescription requires clinical and laboratory monitoring.
"Girls and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or have childbearing potential should not use valproate."
Lithium and carbamazepine also need to be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding whenever possible.
Antidepressants should not be taken during a manic episode and they may be combined with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics during episodes of depression.
"Some medicines for bipolar disorder can make people feel sleepy, have involuntary muscle spasms or tremors, or experience metabolic changes (e.g."
involving weight gain).
These side effects can affect adherence to treatment and should be monitored and managed.
Adults with bipolar disorder who are in complete remission (no symptoms) usually need to continue with mood stabilizers or antipsychotic medicines for at least six months.
Those experiencing multiple episodes of mania and depression will usually require longer-term treatment to minimize relapses.
Psychological and psychosocial interventions
"People with bipolar disorder can benefit from lifestyle changes involving regular sleep, physical activity, a healthy diet, reduction of stressors, and mood monitoring."
Psychological interventions (e.g.
"cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, psychoeducation) can effectively reduce depressive symptoms and the possibility of them coming back."
Family psychoeducation can also help families understand and support their loved one better.
Support from family and friends is very important.
"Support groups – where people can receive encouragement, learn coping skills, and share experiences – can be helpful to people with bipolar disorder and their families."
"Recovery-oriented psychosocial interventions include supported employment, supported housing, peer support, and social and life skills training."
"They serve to promote hope and to support the autonomy, personal empowerment and social inclusion of people with bipolar disorder."
Medicines and psychological or psychosocial interventions should be tailored to the needs of the person and combined for best outcomes.
WHO response
"The Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 highlights the steps needed to provide appropriate services for people with mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder."
The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health aims to further progress towards the plan’s objectives by ensuring 100 million more people can access quality and affordable care for mental health conditions.
"WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which is being implemented in more than 100 countries, provides evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to build capacities and expand treatment coverage for a set of priority conditions, including bipolar disorder, in non-specialized settings in LMICs."
"WHO’s guidelines on Management of physical health conditions in adults with severe mental disorders provide evidence-based recommendations to practitioners on how to recognize and manage comorbid physical and mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder."
"WHO’s QualityRights initiative aims to improve the quality of care and human rights standards in mental health and social care facilities and to empower organizations to advocate for the health of people with mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder."
"The Guidance on community mental health services and person-centred and rights-based approaches describes what person-centred and human rights-based approaches look like in mental health, and give examples of good practice services."
Key facts
Depression is a common mental disorder.
"Globally, an estimated 5% of adults suffer from depression."
More women are affected by depression than men.
Depression can lead to suicide.
"There is effective treatment for mild, moderate and severe depression."
Overview
Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder.
It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time.
Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life.
"It can affect all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community."
It can result from or lead to problems at school and at work.
Depression can happen to anyone.
"People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression."
Women are more likely to have depression than men.
"An estimated 3.8% of the population experience depression, including 5% of adults (4% among men and 6% among women), and 5.7% of adults older than 60 years."
Approximately 280 million people in the world have depression (1).
Depression is about 50% more common among women than among men.
"Worldwide, more than 10% of pregnant women and women who have just given birth experience depression (2)."
More than 700 000 people die due to suicide every year.
Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15–29-year-olds.
"Although there are known, effective treatments for mental disorders, more than 75% of people in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment (3)."
"Barriers to effective care include a lack of investment in mental health care, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders."
Symptoms and patterns
"During a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty)."
They may feel a loss of pleasure or interest in activities.
A depressive episode is different from regular mood fluctuations.
"They last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks."
"Other symptoms are also present, which may include:"
""
poor concentration
feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth
hopelessness about the future
thoughts about dying or suicide
disrupted sleep
changes in appetite or weight
feeling very tired or low in energy.
"Depression can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including in the community and at home, work and school."
"A depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number and severity of symptoms, as well as the impact on the individual’s functioning."
There are different patterns of depressive episodes including:
""
"single episode depressive disorder, meaning the person’s first and only episode;"
"recurrent depressive disorder, meaning the person has a history of at least two depressive episodes; and"
"bipolar disorder, meaning that depressive episodes alternate with periods of manic symptoms, which include euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour."
Contributing factors and prevention
"Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors."
"People who have gone through adverse life events (unemployment, bereavement, traumatic events) are more likely to develop depression."
"Depression can, in turn, lead to more stress and dysfunction and worsen the affected person’s life situation and the depression itself."
Depression is closely related to and affected by physical health.
"Many of the factors that influence depression (such as physical inactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases."
"In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing depression due to the difficulties associated with managing their condition."
Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression.
Effective community approaches to prevent depression include school-based programmes to enhance a pattern of positive coping in children and adolescents.
Interventions for parents of children with behavioural problems may reduce parental depressive symptoms and improve outcomes for their children.
Exercise programmes for older persons can also be effective in depression prevention.
Diagnosis and treatment
There are effective treatments for depression.
These include psychological treatment and medications.
Seek care if you have symptoms of depression.
Psychological treatments are the first treatments for depression.
They can be combined with antidepressant medications in moderate and severe depression.
Antidepressant medications are not needed for mild depression.
"Psychological treatments can teach new ways of thinking, coping or relating to others."
They may include talk therapy with professionals and supervised lay therapists.
Talk therapy can happen in person or online.
"Psychological treatments may be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps."
Effective psychological treatments for depression include:   
""
behavioural activation
cognitive behavioural therapy
interpersonal psychotherapy
problem-solving therapy.
"Antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine."
"Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences."
"Antidepressants should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with extra caution."
Different medications and treatments are used for bipolar disorder.
Self-care
Self-care can play an important role in managing symptoms of depression and promoting overall well-being.
What you can do:
""
try to keep doing activities you used to enjoy
stay connected to friends and family
"exercise regularly, even if it’s just a short walk"
stick to regular eating and sleeping habits as much as possible
"avoid or cut down on alcohol and don’t use illicit drugs, which can make depression worse"
talk to someone you trust about your feelings 
seek help from a healthcare provider.
If you have thoughts of suicide:
""
"remember you are not alone, and that many people have gone through what you’re experiencing and found help"
talk to someone you trust about how you feel
"talk to a health worker, such as a doctor or counsellor"
join a support group.
"If you think you are in immediate danger of harming yourself, contact any available emergency services or a crisis line."
WHO response
WHO’s Mental health action plan 2013–2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental disorders including depression.
Depression and self-harm/suicide are among the priority conditions covered by WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).
"The Programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health."
WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals for depression that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups.
"An example is the Problem management plus (PM+) manual, which describes the use of behavioural activation, stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support."
"Moreover, the Group interpersonal therapy for depression manual describes group treatment of depression."
"Finally, the Thinking healthy manual covers the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy for perinatal depression."
Key facts
"Schizophrenia causes psychosis and is associated with considerable disability and may affect all areas of life including personal, family, social, educational, and occupational functioning."
"Stigma, discrimination, and violation of human rights of people with schizophrenia are common."
More than two out of three people with psychosis in the world do not receive specialist mental health care.
A range of effective care options for people with schizophrenia exist and at least one in three people with schizophrenia will be able to fully recover.
Symptoms
Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in the way reality is perceived and changes in behaviour related to:
""
"persistent delusions: the person has fixed beliefs that something is true, despite evidence to the contrary;"
"persistent hallucinations: the person may hear, smell, see, touch, or feel things that are not there;"
"experiences of influence, control or passivity: the experience that one’s feelings, impulses, actions, or thoughts are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one’s mind or withdrawn from one’s mind by others, or that one’s thoughts are being broadcast to others;"
"disorganized thinking, which is often observed as jumbled or irrelevant speech;"
highly disorganised behaviour e.g.
"the person does things that appear bizarre or purposeless, or the person has unpredictable or inappropriate emotional responses that interfere with their ability to organise their behaviour;"
"“negative symptoms” such as very limited speech, restricted experience and expression of emotions, inability to experience interest or pleasure, and social withdrawal; and/or "
"extreme agitation or slowing of movements, maintenance of unusual postures."
"People with schizophrenia often also experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive or thinking skills, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving."
At least one third of people with schizophrenia experiences complete remission of symptoms (1).
"Some people with schizophrenia experience worsening and remission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others a gradual worsening of symptoms over time."
Magnitude and impact
""
Schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people or 1 in 300 people (0.32%) worldwide.
This rate is 1 in 222 people (0.45%) among adults (2).
It is not as common as many other mental disorders.
"Onset is most often during late adolescence and the twenties, and onset tends to happen earlier among men than among women."
"Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of life."
People with schizophrenia are 2 to 3 times more likely to die early than the general population (3).
"This is often due to physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases."
People with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings.
"Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships with others, including family and friends."
"This contributes to discrimination, which in turn can limit access to general health care, education, housing, and employment."
"During humanitarian and public health emergencies, extreme stress and fear, breakdown of social supports, isolation and disruption of health-care services and supply of medication can occur."
"These changes can have an impact on the lives of people with schizophrenia, such as exacerbation of existing symptoms."
"During emergencies, people with schizophrenia are more vulnerable than others to various human rights violations, including neglect, abandonment, homelessness, abuse and exclusion."
Causes of schizophrenia
Research has not identified one single cause of schizophrenia.
It is thought that an interaction between genes and a range of environmental factors may cause schizophrenia.
Psychosocial factors may also affect the onset and course of schizophrenia.
Heavy use of cannabis is associated with an elevated risk of the disorder.
Services
"Currently, the vast majority of people with schizophrenia around the world are not receiving mental health care."
Approximately 50% of people in mental hospitals have a schizophrenia diagnosis (4).
Only 31.3% of people with psychosis receive specialist mental health care (5).
Most resources for mental health services are inefficiently spent on care within mental hospitals.
"There is clear evidence that mental hospitals are not effective in providing the care that people with mental health conditions need and, regularly, violate the basic human rights of persons with schizophrenia."
Efforts to transfer care from mental health institutions to the community need to be expanded and accelerated.
Such efforts start with the development of a range of quality community-based mental health services.
"Options for community-based mental health care include integration in primary health and general hospital care, community mental health centres, day centres, supported housing, and outreach services for home-based support."
"The engagement of the person with schizophrenia, family members and the wider community in providing support is important."
Management and support
"A range of effective care options for people with schizophrenia exist, and these include medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychosocial rehabilitation (e.g., life skills  training)."
"Facilitated assisted living, supported housing and supported employment are essential care options that should be available for people with schizophrenia."
A recovery-oriented approach – giving people agency in treatment decisions – is essential for people with schizophrenia and for their families and/or caregivers as well.
WHO response
WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate services for people with mental disorders including schizophrenia.
A key recommendation of the Action Plan is to shift services from institutions to the community.
The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health aims to further progress towards objectives of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 by ensuring 100 million more people have access to quality and affordable care for mental health conditions.
"WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) uses evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to expand service in countries, especially in resource-poor settings."
"It focuses on a prioritized set of conditions, including psychosis, directing capacity building towards non-specialized health-care providers in an integrated approach that promotes mental health at all levels of care."
Currently mhGAP is being implemented in more than 100 WHO Member States.
The WHO QualityRights Project involves improving the quality of care and human rights conditions in mental health and social care facilities and to empower organizations to advocate for the health of people with mental health conditions and psychosocial disabilities.
The WHO guidance on community mental health services and person-centred and rights-based approaches  provides information and support to all stakeholders who wish to develop or transform their mental health system and services to align with international human rights standards including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Key facts
More than 720 000 people die due to suicide every year.
Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds.
Seventy-three per cent of global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries.
"The reasons for suicide are multi-faceted, influenced by social, cultural, biological, psychological, and environmental factors present across the life-course."
For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide.
A prior suicide attempt is an important risk factor for suicide in the general population.
Overview
Every year 726 000 people take their own life and there are many more people who make suicide attempts.
"Every suicide is a tragedy that affects families, communities and entire countries and has long-lasting effects on the people left behind."
Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and was the third leading cause of death among 15–29-year-olds globally in 2021.
Suicide does not just occur in high-income countries but is a global phenomenon in all regions of the world.
"In fact, close to three quarters (73%) of global suicides occurred in low- and middle-income countries in 2021."
Suicide is a serious public health problem that requires a public health response.
"With timely, evidence-based and often low-cost interventions, suicides can be prevented."
"For national responses to be effective, a comprehensive multisectoral suicide prevention strategy is needed."
Who is at risk?
"The link between suicide and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) and a previous suicide attempt is well established in high-income countries."
"However, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship disputes, or chronic pain and illness."
"In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behaviour."
"Suicide rates are also high among vulnerable groups who experience discrimination, such as refugees and migrants; indigenous peoples; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex (LGBTI) persons; and prisoners."
Prevention and control
"There are several measures that can be taken at population, sub-population and individual levels to prevent suicide and self-harm."
"LIVE LIFE, WHO’s initiative for suicide prevention, recommends the following key effective evidence-based interventions:"
""
limit access to the means of suicide (e.g.
"pesticides, firearms, certain medications);"
interact with the media for responsible reporting of suicide;
foster socio-emotional life skills in adolescents; and
"early identify, assess, manage and follow up anyone who is affected by suicidal behaviours."
"These need to go hand-in-hand with the following foundational pillars: situation analysis, multisectoral collaboration, awareness raising, capacity building, financing, surveillance and monitoring and evaluation."
"Suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defence, politics and the media."
These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated given the multifaceted nature of suicide.
Challenges and obstacles
Stigma and taboo
"Stigma, particularly surrounding mental disorders and suicide, means many people thinking of taking their own life or who have attempted suicide are not seeking help and are therefore not getting the help they need."
The prevention of suicide has not been adequately addressed due to a lack of awareness of suicide as a major public health problem and the taboo in many societies to openly discuss it.
"To date, only a few countries have included suicide prevention among their health priorities and only 38 countries report having a national suicide prevention strategy."
Raising community awareness and breaking down the taboo is important for countries to make progress in preventing suicide.
Data quality
"Globally, the availability and quality of data on suicide and self-harm is poor."
Only some 80 WHO Member States have good-quality vital registration data that can be used directly to estimate suicide rates.
"This problem of poor-quality mortality data is not unique to suicide, but given the stigma surrounding suicide – and the illegality of suicidal behaviour in some countries – it is likely that under-reporting and misclassification are greater problems for suicide than for most other causes of death."
Improved surveillance and monitoring of suicide and self-harm are required for effective suicide prevention strategies.
"Cross-national differences in the patterns of suicide, and changes in the rates, characteristics and methods of suicide, highlight the need for each country to improve the comprehensiveness, quality and timeliness of their suicide-related data."
"This includes vital registration of suicide, hospital-based registries of self-harm and nationally representative surveys collecting information about self-reported self-harm."
WHO response
The urgency to act to prevent suicides has been recognized and prioritized at the highest levels.
"The reduction of the suicide rate is an indicator in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (the only indicator for mental health), WHO’s General Programme of Work and WHO’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030."
"The first WHO world suicide report, Preventing suicide: a global imperative, published in 2014, aimed to increase the awareness of the public health significance of suicide and suicide attempts and to make suicide prevention a high priority on the global public health agenda."
It also aimed to encourage and support countries to develop or strengthen comprehensive national suicide prevention strategies through a multisectoral public health approach.
"In 2021, WHO launched LIVE LIFE: an implementation guide for suicide prevention in countries."
"Accompanying resources to support the implementation of the four key LIVE LIFE interventions have also been published including the 2024 brochure on Preventing suicide by phasing out highly hazardous pesticides to support limiting access to means, Preventing suicide: a resource for media professionals, update 2023 to encourage responsible reporting of suicide, and the Helping Adolescents Thrive toolkit to foster socio-emotional life-skills among young people."
"At the health sector level, suicide/self-harm is one of the priority conditions in the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which provides evidence-based technical guidance to scale up service provision and care in countries for mental, neurological and substance use disorders."
"The mhGAP Intervention Guide (‎mhGAP-IG)‎ includes a specific module for suicide and self-harm to support early identification, assessment, management and follow-up."
"Through the LIVE LIFE initiative, governments are encouraged and supported to implement a suite of evidence-based interventions and foundational pillars for suicide prevention."
Key facts
Decent work is good for mental health.
"Poor working environments – including discrimination and inequality, excessive workloads, low job control and job insecurity – pose a risk to mental health."
15% of working-age adults were estimated to have a mental disorder in 2019.
"Globally, an estimated 12 billion working days are lost every year to depression and anxiety at a cost of US$ 1 trillion per year in lost productivity."
"There are effective actions to prevent mental health risks at work, protect and promote mental health at work, and support workers with mental health conditions."
Overview
Almost 60% of the world population is in work (1).
All workers have the right to a safe and healthy environment at work.
Work can protect mental health.
Decent work supports good mental health by providing:
""
a livelihood;
"a sense of confidence, purpose and achievement;"
an opportunity for positive relationships and inclusion in a community; and
"a platform for structured routines, among many other benefits."
"For people with mental health conditions, decent work can contribute to recovery and inclusion, improve confidence and social functioning."
"Safe and healthy working environments are not only a fundamental right but are also more likely to minimize tension and conflicts at work and improve staff retention, work performance and productivity."
"Conversely, a lack of effective structures and support at work, especially for those living with mental health conditions, can affect a person’s ability to enjoy their work and do their job well; it can undermine people’s attendance at work and even stop people getting a job in the first place."
Risks to mental health at work
"At work, risks to mental health, also called psychosocial risks, may be related to job content or work schedule, specific characteristics of the workplace or opportunities for career development among other things."
Risks to mental health at work can include:
""
under-use of skills or being under-skilled for work;
"excessive workloads or work pace, understaffing;"
"long, unsocial or inflexible hours;"
lack of control over job design or workload;
unsafe or poor physical working conditions;
organizational culture that enables negative behaviours;
limited support from colleagues or authoritarian supervision;
"violence, harassment or bullying;"
discrimination and exclusion;
unclear job role;
under- or over-promotion;
"job insecurity, inadequate pay, or poor investment in career development; and"
conflicting home/work demands.
"More than half the global workforce works in the informal economy (2), where there is no regulatory protection for health and safety."
"These workers often operate in unsafe working environments, work long hours, have little or no access to social or financial protections and face discrimination, all of which can undermine mental health."
"Although psychosocial risks can be found in all sectors, some workers are more likely to be exposed to them than others, because of what they do or where and how they work."
"Health, humanitarian or emergency workers often have jobs that carry an elevated risk of exposure to adverse events, which can negatively impact mental health."
"Economic recessions or humanitarian and public health emergencies elicit risks such as job loss, financial instability, reduced employment opportunities or increased unemployment."
"Work can be a setting which amplifies wider issues that negatively affect mental health, including discrimination and inequality based on factors such as, race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, social origin, migrant status, religion or age."
"People with severe mental health conditions are more likely to be excluded from employment, and when in employment, they are more likely to experience inequality at work."
Being out of work also poses a risk to mental health.
"Unemployment, job and financial insecurity, and recent job loss are risk factors for suicide attempts."
Action for mental health at work
"Government, employers, the organizations which represent workers and employers, and other stakeholders responsible for workers’ health and safety can help to improve mental health at work through action to:"
""
prevent work-related mental health conditions by preventing the risks to mental health at work;
protect and promote mental health at work;
support workers with mental health conditions to participate and thrive in work; and
create an enabling environment for change.
"Action to address mental health at work should be done with the meaningful involvement of workers and their representatives, and persons with lived experience of mental health conditions."
Prevent work-related mental health conditions
Preventing mental health conditions at work is about managing psychosocial risks in the workplace.
WHO recommends employers do this by implementing organizational interventions that directly target working conditions and environments.
"Organizational interventions are those that assess, and then mitigate, modify or remove workplace risks to mental health."
"Organizational interventions include, for example, providing flexible working arrangements, or implementing frameworks to deal with violence and harassment at work."
Protect and promote mental health at work
"Protecting and promoting mental health at work is about strengthening capacities to recognize and act on mental health conditions at work, particularly for persons responsible for the supervision of others, such as managers."
"To protect mental health, WHO recommends:"
""
"manager training for mental health, which helps managers recognize and respond to supervisees experiencing emotional distress; builds interpersonal skills like open communication and active listening; and fosters better understanding of how job stressors affect mental health and can be managed;"
"training for workers in mental health literacy and awareness, to improve knowledge of mental health and reduce stigma against mental health conditions at work; and"
"interventions for individuals to build skills to manage stress and reduce mental health symptoms, including psychosocial interventions and opportunities for leisure-based physical activity."
Support people with mental health conditions to participate in and thrive at work
People living with mental health conditions have a right to participate in work fully and fairly.
"The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides an international agreement for promoting the rights of people with disabilities (including psychosocial disabilities), including at work."
"WHO recommends three interventions to support people with mental health conditions gain, sustain and participate in work:"
""
"Reasonable accommodations at work adapt working environments to the capacities, needs and preferences of a worker with a mental health condition."
"They may include giving individual workers flexible working hours, extra time to complete tasks, modified assignments to reduce stress, time off for health appointments or regular supportive meetings with supervisors."
"Return-to-work programmes combine work-directed care (like reasonable accommodations or phased re-entry to work) with ongoing clinical care to support workers in meaningfully returning to work after an absence associated with mental health conditions, while also reducing mental health symptoms."
Supported employment initiatives help people with severe mental health conditions to get into paid work and maintain their time on work through continue to provide mental health and vocational support.
Create an enabling environment for change
"Both governments and employers, in consultation with key stakeholders, can help improve mental health at work by creating an enabling environment for change."
In practice this means strengthening:
""
"Leadership and commitment to mental health at work, for example by integrating mental health at work into relevant policies."
"Investment of sufficient funds and resources, for example by establishing dedicated budgets for actions to improve mental health at work and making mental health and employment services available to lower-resourced enterprises."
"Rights to participate in work, for example by aligning employment laws and regulations with international human rights instruments and implementing non-discrimination policies at work."
"Integration of mental health at work across sectors, for example by embedding mental health into existing systems for occupational safety and health."
"Participation of workers in decision-making, for example by holding meaningful and timely consultations with workers, their representatives and people with lived experience of mental health conditions."
"Evidence on psychosocial risks and effectiveness of interventions, for example by ensuring that all guidance and action on mental health at work is based on the latest evidence."
"Compliance with laws, regulations and recommendations, for example by integrating mental health into the responsibilities of national labour inspectorates and other compliance mechanisms."
WHO response
WHO is committed to improving mental health at work.
"The WHO global strategy on health, environment and climate change and WHO Comprehensive mental health action plan (2013–2030) outline relevant principles, objectives and implementation strategies to enable good mental health in the workplace."
"These include addressing social determinants of mental health, such as living standards and working conditions; reducing stigma and discrimination; and increasing access to evidence-based care through health service development, including access to occupational health services."
"In 2022, WHO’s World mental health report: transforming mental health for all, highlighted the workplace as a key example of a setting where transformative action on mental health is needed."
"The WHO guidelines on mental health at work provide evidence-based recommendations to promote mental health, prevent mental health conditions, and enable people living with mental health conditions to participate and thrive in work."
"The recommendations cover organizational interventions, manager training and worker training, individual interventions, return to work, and gaining employment."
"The accompanying policy brief by WHO and the International Labour Organization, Mental health at work: policy brief provides a pragmatic framework for implementing the WHO recommendations."
"It specifically sets out what governments, employers, organizations representing employers and workers, and other stakeholders can do to improve mental health at work."
Key facts
"Almost all people affected by emergencies will experience psychological distress, which for most people will improve over time."
"Among people who have experienced war or other conflict in the previous 10 years, one in five (22%) will have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia."
People with severe mental disorders are especially vulnerable during emergencies and need access to mental health care and other basic needs.
"International guidelines recommend services at a number of levels ̶ from basic services to clinical care ̶ and indicate that mental health care needs to be made available immediately for specific, urgent mental health problems as part of the health response."
"Despite their tragic nature and adverse effects on mental health, emergencies have shown to be opportunities to build sustainable mental health systems for all people in need."
Types of problems
There are various types of social and mental health problems in any large emergency.
Social problems:

pre-existing: e.g.
poverty and discrimination of marginalized groups;
emergency-induced: e.g.
"family separation, lack of safety, loss of livelihoods, disrupted social networks, and low trust and resources; and"
humanitarian response-induced: e.g.
"overcrowding, lack of privacy, and undermining of community or traditional support."
Mental health problems:
""
pre-existing: e.g.
"mental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia or harmful use of alcohol;"
emergency-induced: e.g.
"grief, acute stress reactions, harmful use of alcohol and drugs, and depression and anxiety, including post-traumatic stress disorder; and"
humanitarian response-induced: e.g.
anxiety due to a lack of information about food distribution or about how to obtain basic services.
Prevalence
Most people affected by emergencies will experience distress (e.g.
"feelings of anxiety and sadness, hopelessness, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, irritability or anger and/or aches and pains)."
This is normal and will for most people improve over time.
"However, the prevalence of common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety is expected to more than double in a humanitarian crisis."
"The burden of mental disorders among conflict-affected populations is extremely high: WHO’s review of 129 studies in 39 countries showed that among people who have experienced war or other conflict in the previous 10 years, one in five people (22%) will have depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia (1)."
"According to WHO’s review, the estimated prevalence of mental disorders among conflict- affected populations at any specific point in time (point prevalence) is 13% for mild forms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder and 4% for moderate forms of these disorders."
The estimated point prevalence for severe disorders (i.e.
"schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression, severe anxiety, and severe post-traumatic stress disorder) is 5%."
It is estimated that one in 11 people (9%) living in a setting that has been exposed to conflict in the previous 10 years will have a moderate or severe mental disorder.
"In conflict-affected settings, depression and anxiety increase with age."
Depression is more common in women than in men.
People with severe mental disorders can be especially vulnerable during and after emergencies and they need access to basic needs and clinical care.
"A review published in 2014 of the health information system from 90 refugee camps across 15 low- and middle-income countries found that 41% of health-care visits for mental, neurological and substance use disorders were for epilepsy/seizures, 23% for psychotic disorders, and 13% for moderate and severe forms of depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder."
Effective emergency response
WHO-endorsed interagency mental health and psychosocial support guidelines for an effective response to emergencies recommend services at a number of levels – from basic services to clinical care.
"Clinical care for mental health should be provided by or under the supervision of mental health specialists such as psychiatric nurses, psychologists or psychiatrists."
"Community self-help and social support should be strengthened, for example by creating or re-establishing community groups in which members solve problems collaboratively and engage in activities such as emergency relief or learning new skills, while ensuring the involvement of people who are vulnerable and marginalized, including people with mental disorders."
"Psychological first aid offers first-line emotional and practical support to people experiencing acute distress due to a recent event and should be made available by field workers, including health staff, teachers or trained volunteers."
Basic clinical mental health care covering priority conditions (e.g.
"depression, psychotic disorders, epilepsy, alcohol and substance abuse) should be provided at every health-care facility by trained and supervised general health staff."
Psychological interventions (e.g.
"problem-solving interventions, group interpersonal therapy, interventions based on the principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy) for people impaired by prolonged distress should be offered by specialists or by trained and supervised community workers in the health and social sector."
Protecting and promoting the rights of people with severe mental health conditions and psychosocial disabilities is especially critical in humanitarian emergencies.
"This includes visiting, monitoring and supporting people at psychiatric facilities and residential homes."
"Links and referral mechanisms need to be established between mental health specialists, general health-care providers, community-based support and other services (e.g."
"schools, social services and emergency relief services such as those providing food, water and housing/shelter)."
Looking forward: emergencies can build better mental health systems
"Mental health is crucial to the overall social and economic recovery of individuals, societies, and countries after emergencies."
"Global progress on mental health reform will happen more quickly if, during every crisis, efforts are initiated to convert the short-term increase in attention to mental health issues combined with a surge of aid, into momentum for long-term service development."
Many countries have capitalized on emergency situations to build better mental health systems after crises.
"In the Syrian Arab Republic, despite — or perhaps because of — the challenges presented by the ongoing conflict, mental health services and psychosocial support are becoming more widely available than ever before."
"Mental health and psychosocial support is now offered in primary and secondary health and social care facilities, through community and women's centres and through school-based programmes, in more than 12 Syrian cities located in governorates severely affected by the conflict."
"This contrasts with the situation before the conflict, when mental health care was mainly provided in mental hospitals in Aleppo and Damascus."
"In Sri Lanka, during the immediate aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, mental health was a key priority."
"This led to a mental health system reform, supported by WHO, which addressed the shortage of human resources for mental health such as different cadres of dedicated mental health staff."
"As a result, 20 of the country’s 27 districts now have mental health services infrastructure, compared with only 10 before the tsunami."
"When Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines in 2013, there were only two facilities that provided basic mental health services and the number of people able to provide support was insufficient to meet the need."
A major scale up of government mental health services was supported by WHO and partners.
"As a result, 100% of the Philippines general health facilities in the affected region now have staff who are trained in the management of mental disorders."
Mental health should also be a component of national disaster preparedness plans.
WHO and the Pan-American Health Organization are supporting countries in the Caribbean sub-region of the Americas so that they will be able to provide adequate mental health and psychosocial support to people in need following hurricanes and other natural disasters.
"In many humanitarian and conflict settings, access to quality, affordable mental health care is limited."
"This access can be further diminished due to public health emergencies such as COVID-19, which tend to disrupt services and increase needs further."
WHO response
WHO is the lead agency in providing technical advice on mental health in emergency situations.
"In 2022 WHO is operational on mental health in a range of countries and territories affected by large-scale emergencies such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey, Ukraine, the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Yemen."
WHO co-chairs the IASC Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS)in Emergency Settings that provides advice and support to organizations working in emergencies and to country-level MHPSS technical working groups in more than 50 countries affected by emergencies.
"The Organization works globally to ensure that the humanitarian mental health response is both coordinated and effective, and that following humanitarian emergencies, all efforts are made to build/rebuild mental health services for the long-term."
WHO’s advice and tools are used by most large international humanitarian organizations active in mental health.
WHO and partners have published a range of practical tools and guidelines to meet the mental health needs of people affected by emergencies.
Key facts
"Globally, one in seven 10-19-year-olds experiences a mental disorder, accounting for 13% of the global burden of disease in this age group."
"Depression, anxiety and behavioural disorders are among the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents."
Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year-olds.
"The consequences of failing to address adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults."
Introduction
One in six people are aged 10–19 years.
Adolescence is a unique and formative time.
"Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems."
"Protecting adolescents from adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological well-being, and ensuring access to mental health care are critical for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood."
"Globally, it is estimated that 1 in 7 (14%) 10–19 year-olds experience mental health conditions (1), yet these remain largely unrecognized and untreated."
"Adolescents with mental health conditions are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion, discrimination, stigma (affecting readiness to seek help), educational difficulties, risk-taking behaviours, physical ill-health and human rights violations."
Mental health determinants
Adolescence is a crucial period for developing social and emotional habits important for mental well-being.
"These include adopting healthy sleep patterns; exercising regularly; developing coping, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning to manage emotions."
"Protective and supportive environments in the family, at school and in the wider community are important."
Multiple factors affect mental health.
"The more risk factors adolescents are exposed to, the greater the potential impact on their mental health."
"Factors that can contribute to stress during adolescence include exposure to adversity, pressure to conform with peers and exploration of identity."
Media influence and gender norms can exacerbate the disparity between an adolescent’s lived reality and their perceptions or aspirations for the future.
Other important determinants include the quality of their home life and relationships with peers.
"Violence (especially sexual violence and bullying), harsh parenting and severe and socioeconomic problems are recognized risks to mental health."
"Some adolescents are at greater risk of mental health conditions due to their living conditions, stigma, discrimination or exclusion, or lack of access to quality support and services."
"These include adolescents living in humanitarian and fragile settings; adolescents with chronic illness, autism spectrum disorder, an intellectual disability or other neurological condition; pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents, or those in early or forced marriages; orphans; and adolescents from minority ethnic or sexual backgrounds or other discriminated groups."
Emotional disorders
Emotional disorders are common among adolescents.
Anxiety disorders (which may involve panic or excessive worry) are the most prevalent in this age group and are more common among older than among younger adolescents.
It is estimated that 3.6% of 10–14-year-olds and 4.6% of 15–19-year-olds experience an anxiety disorder.
"Depression is estimated to occur among 1.1% of adolescents aged 10–14 years, and 2.8% of 15–19-year-olds."
"Depression and anxiety share some of the same symptoms, including rapid and unexpected changes in mood."
Anxiety and depressive disorders can profoundly affect school attendance and schoolwork.
Social withdrawal can exacerbate isolation and loneliness.
Depression can lead to suicide.
Behavioural disorders
Behavioural disorders are more common among younger adolescents than older adolescents.
"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), characterized by difficulty paying attention, excessive activity and acting without regard to consequences, occurs among 3.1% of 10–14-year-olds and 2.4% of 15–19-year-olds (1)."
Conduct disorder (involving symptoms of destructive or challenging behaviour) occurs among 3.6% of 10–14-year-olds and 2.4% of 15–19-year-olds (1).
Behavioural disorders can affect adolescents’ education and conduct disorder may result in criminal behaviour.
Eating disorders
"Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, commonly emerge during adolescence and young adulthood."
"Eating disorders involve abnormal eating behaviour and preoccupation with food, accompanied in most instances by concerns about body weight and shape."
"Anorexia nervosa can lead to premature death, often due to medical complications or suicide, and has higher mortality than any other mental disorder."
Psychosis
Conditions that include symptoms of psychosis most commonly emerge in late adolescence or early adulthood.
Symptoms can include hallucinations or delusions.
These experiences can impair an adolescent’s ability to participate in daily life and education and often lead to stigma or human rights violations.
Suicide and self-harm
Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in older adolescents (15–19 years) (2).
"Risk factors for suicide are multifaceted, and include harmful use of alcohol, abuse in childhood, stigma against help-seeking, barriers to accessing care and access to means of suicide."
"Digital media, like any other media, can play a significant role in either enhancing or weakening suicide prevention efforts."
Risk-taking behaviours
"Many risk-taking behaviours for health, such as substance use or sexual risk-taking, start during adolescence."
Risk-taking behaviours can be an unhelpful strategy to cope with emotional difficulties and can severely impact an adolescent’s mental and physical well-being.
"Worldwide, the prevalence of heavy episodic drinking among adolescents aged 15­–19 years was 13.6% in 2016, with males most at risk (3)."
The use of tobacco and cannabis are additional concerns.
Many adult smokers had their first cigarette prior to the age of 18 years.
Cannabis is the most widely used drug among young people with about 4.7% of 15–16-years-olds using it at least once in 2018 (4).
"Perpetration of violence is a risk-taking behaviour that can increase the likelihood of low educational attainment, injury, involvement with crime or death."
Interpersonal violence was ranked among the leading causes of death of older adolescent boys in 2019 (5).
Promotion and prevention
"Mental health promotion and prevention interventions aim to strengthen an individual's capacity to regulate emotions, enhance alternatives to risk-taking behaviours, build resilience for managing difficult situations and adversity, and promote supportive social environments and social networks."
"These programmes require a multi-level approach with varied delivery platforms – for example, digital media, health or social care settings, schools or the community – and varied strategies to reach adolescents, particularly the most vulnerable."
Early detection and treatment
It is crucial to address the needs of adolescents with mental health conditions.
"Avoiding institutionalization and over-medicalization, prioritizing non-pharmacological approaches, and respecting the rights of children in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights instruments are key for adolescents’ mental health."
WHO response
"WHO works on strategies, programmes and tools to assist governments in responding to the health needs of adolescents."
"For example, the Helping Adolescents Thrive (HAT) Initiative is a joint WHO-UNICEF effort to strengthen policies and programmes for the mental health of adolescents."
"More specifically, the efforts made through the Initiative are to promote mental health and prevent mental health conditions."
"They are also intended to help prevent self-harm and other risk behaviours, such as harmful use of alcohol and drugs, that have a negative impact on the mental  ̶  and physical  ̶  health of young people."
WHO has also developed a module on Child and Adolescent Mental and Behavioural Disorders as part of the mhGAP Intervention Guide 2.0.
This Guide  provides evidence-based clinical protocols for the assessment and management of a range of mental health conditions in non-specialized care settings.
"Furthermore, WHO is developing and testing scalable psychological interventions to address emotional disorders of adolescents, and guidance on mental health services for adolescents."
"WHO’s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean has developed a mental health training package for educators for improved understanding of the importance of mental health in the school setting and to guide the implementation of strategies to promote, protect and restore mental health among their students."
It includes training manuals and materials to help scale up the number of schools promoting mental health.
Key facts
"By 2030, one in six people in the world will be aged 60 years or over."
Loneliness and social isolation are key risk factors for mental health conditions in later life.
"One in six older adults experience abuse, often by their own carers."
Approximately 14% of adults aged 60 and over live with a mental disorder.
Mental disorders among older adults account for 10.6% of the total years lived with disability for this age group.
Overview
The world’s population is ageing fast.
"In 2020, 1 billion people in the world were aged 60 years or over."
"That figure will rise to 1.4 billion by 2030, representing one in six people globally."
"By 2050, the number of people aged 60 years and over will have doubled to reach 2.1 billion."
The number of persons aged 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050 to reach 426 million (1).
"Older adults contribute to society as family and community members, and many are volunteers and workers."
"While most have good health, many are at risk of developing mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders."
"Many may also experience reduced mobility, chronic pain, frailty, dementia or other health problems, for which they require some form of long-term care."
"As people age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time."
Prevalence
Around 14% of adults aged 60 and over live with a mental disorder (2).
"According to the Global Health Estimates (GHE) 2019, these conditions account for 10.6% of the total disability (in disability adjusted life years, DALYs) among older adults."
The most common mental health conditions for older adults are depression and anxiety.
"GHE 2019 shows that globally, around a quarter of deaths from suicide (27.2%) are among people aged 60 or over."
"Mental health conditions among older people are often underrecognized and undertreated, and the stigma surrounding these conditions can make people reluctant to seek help."
Risk factors
"At older ages, mental health is shaped not only by physical and social environments but also by the cumulative impacts of earlier life experiences and specific stressors related to ageing."
"Exposure to adversity, significant loss in intrinsic capacity and a decline in functional ability can all result in psychological distress."
"Older adults are more likely to experience adverse events such as bereavement, or a drop in income or reduced sense of purpose with retirement."
"Despite their many contributions to society, many older adults are subject to ageism, which can seriously affect people’s mental health."
"Social isolation and loneliness, which affect about a quarter of older people, are key risk factors for mental health conditions in later life (3)."
"So too is abuse of older people, which includes any kind of physical, verbal, psychological, sexual or financial abuse, as well as neglect."
"One in six older adults experience abuse, often by their own carers (4)."
Abuse of older adults has serious consequences and can lead to depression and anxiety.
"Many older people are carers of spouses with chronic health conditions, such as dementia."
The responsibilities of such care can be overwhelming and can affect the carer’s mental health.
"Some older adults are at greater risk of depression and anxiety, because of dire living conditions, poor physical health or lack of access to quality support and services."
"This includes older adults living in humanitarian settings and those living with chronic illnesses (such as heart disease, cancer or stroke), neurological conditions (such as dementia), or substance use problems."
Promotion and prevention
Mental health promotion and prevention strategies for older adults focus on supporting healthy ageing.
"That means creating physical and social environments that support well-being and enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity."
Key mental health promotion and prevention strategies for healthy ageing include:
""
measures to reduce financial insecurity and income inequality;
"programmes to ensure safe and accessible housing, public buildings and transport;"
social support for older adults and their carers;
"support for healthy behaviours, especially to eat a balanced diet, be physically active, refrain from tobacco and reduce alcohol use; and"
health and social programmes targeted at vulnerable groups such as those who live alone or in remote areas and those living with a chronic health condition.
"For older adults, social connection is particularly important to reduce risk factors such as social isolation and loneliness."
"At this stage of life, meaningful social activities can significantly improve positive mental health, life satisfaction and quality of life; they can also reduce depressive symptoms."
"Example interventions include befriending initiatives, community and support groups, social skills training, creative arts groups, leisure and education services and volunteering programmes."
Protection from ageism and abuse is also critical.
"Key interventions include anti-discrimination policies and laws, educational interventions and intergenerational activities."
"A range of carer interventions – including respite care, advice, education, financial support and psychological interventions – can support carers to maintain a good and healthy caring relationship that avoids abuse of older people."
Treatment and care
Prompt recognition and treatment of mental health conditions (and associated neurological and substance use conditions) in older adults is essential.
"This should follow standards for integrated care for older people, which is community-based and focused on both the long-term care of older adults living with mental health conditions and declines in intrinsic capacity, as well as the education, training and support of carers."
"A mix of mental health interventions are usually recommended, alongside other supports to address the health, personal care and social needs of individuals."
Dementia is often an important concern.
"It affects people’s mental health (for example, sparking symptoms of psychosis and depression), and requires access to quality mental health care."
Responding to the abuse of older adults is also critical.
"Promising interventions include mandatory reporting of abuse, self-help groups, helplines and emergency shelters, psychological programmes for abusers, training of health care providers and other caregiver support interventions."
WHO response
"WHO works with diverse partners on strategies, programmes and tools to support governments respond to the mental health needs of older adults."
"For example, the Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) is a global collaboration led by WHO to improve the lives of older people, their families and the communities in which they live."
"WHO Member States have also endorsed the Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030, which supports improved mental health and mental health care for all populations, including older adults."
"WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) provides evidence-based clinical protocols for assessing, managing and following up a set of priority mental, neurological and substance use conditions in non-specialized settings, including depression and dementia."
The mhGAP intervention guide includes clinical tips for working with older adults.
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO and partners in the Inter-Agency-Standing Committee (IASC) developed the Living with the times toolkit of illustrated posters to help older adults maintain good mental health and well-being."
"Other WHO activities to support the mental health of older adults include the development of scalable psychological interventions to address depression and anxiety, research and guidance on interventions to reduce social isolation and loneliness, and cost–effective solutions to prevent abuse of older adults."
"Mental health encompasses a range of mental, emotional, social, and behavioral functioning and occurs along a continuum from good to poor."
Previous research has documented that mental health among children and adolescents is associated with immediate and long-term physical
"health and chronic disease, health risk behaviors, social relationships, education, and employment."
Public health surveillance of children’s
"mental health can be used to monitor trends in prevalence across populations, increase knowledge about demographic and geographic"
"differences, and support decision-making about prevention and intervention."
Numerous federal data systems collect data on various indicators
"of children’s mental health, particularly mental disorders."
The 2013–2019 data from these data systems show that mental disorders begin
in early childhood and affect children with a range of sociodemographic characteristics.
"During this period, the most prevalent disorders"
"diagnosed among U.S. children and adolescents aged 3–17 years were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and anxiety, each affecting"
approximately one in 11 (9.4%–9.8%) children.
"Among children and adolescents aged 12–17 years, one fifth (20.9%) had ever experienced"
a major depressive episode.
"Among high school students in 2019, 36.7% reported persistently feeling sad or hopeless in the past year, and"
18.8% had seriously considered attempting suicide.
"Approximately seven in 100,000 persons aged 10–19 years died by suicide in 2018 and"
2019.
"Among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years, 9.6%–10.1% had received mental health services, and 7.8% of all children and"
"adolescents aged 3–17 years had taken medication for mental health problems during the past year, based on parent report."
Approximately
one in four children and adolescents aged 12–17 years reported having received mental health services during the past year.
In federal data
"systems, data on positive indicators of mental health (e.g., resilience) are limited."
Although no comprehensive surveillance system for children’s
mental health exists and no single indicator can be used to define the mental health of children or to identify the overall number of children
"with mental disorders, these data confirm that mental disorders among children continue to be a substantial public health concern."
These
"findings can be used by public health professionals, health care providers, state health officials, policymakers, and educators to understand"
the prevalence of specific mental disorders and other indicators of mental health and the challenges related to mental health surveillance.
"Mental health is a broad label that encompasses a range of mental, emotional, social, and behavioral functioning."
"Mental health, like physical health, occurs along a continuum from good to poor and varies over time, in different conditions, and at different ages (1–3)."
"Good mental health in children includes indicators such as the timely achievement of developmental milestones, healthy social and emotional development, and effective regulatory and coping skills; mentally healthy children function well in various settings including the home, school, and community (4–7)."
"Poor mental health and patterns of symptoms that are severe, are persistent, and cause impairment or dysfunction can develop into mental disorders (1)."
"Mental disorders are defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) as clinically significant cognitive, emotional regulation, or behavior disturbances that reflect dysfunction in psychological, biological, or developmental mental function processes (1)."
"Mental disorders are typically conceptualized as categorical (i.e., above or below a clinical cutoff of symptom or impairment scales), and children receive a diagnosis of a disorder when they have specific"
symptoms that meet specified criteria (1).
"Common mental disorders in children include anxiety, depression, attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavioral disorders (8)."
"Good mental health is not simply the absence of a mental disorder; persons with diagnosed mental disorders can still have good mental health (e.g., if receiving adequate treatment and support) (3,7,9)."
"Throughout life, mental health and mental disorders are associated with immediate and long-term measures of physical health and chronic disease and with social determinants of health such as racial and ethnic minority status and any associated racial bias, social relationships, presence or absence of crime, and factors that determine access to resources such as education level, income level, and employment status (10–22)."
These and other social determinants of health that affect the environments in which children develop contribute to wide health disparities (23).
"Because of the direct connection between mental and physical health, promoting mental health, particularly in the context of social determinants of health, is essential to promoting health equity (24)."
"Research has documented that policies and programs provided during childhood that improve children’s mental health also improve longer-term health and functioning and also might prevent children from developing a diagnosable disorder (2,25–27)."
"Thus, promoting good mental health and addressing mental disorders among children are critical public health issues."
"Data on indicators of good and poor mental health, including mental disorders, can indicate where mental health promotion strategies are needed and how programs are affecting the mental health of the population."
"Public health surveillance focuses on determining the prevalence of health conditions, can be used to monitor trends and changes in prevalence across subpopulations, and increases knowledge about sociodemographic and geographic differences in health indicators, which in turn increases knowledge of social determinants of health that affect health equity (23,24)."
"Thus, public health surveillance provides the foundation for decision-making (28)."
"Although mental health has increasingly become a focus of public health, surveillance efforts regarding mental health and mental disorders both among adults and children have faced various challenges, including insufficient timeliness; limited availability of data sources, particularly for state and local data; and lack of measures that are consistent and include a full set of specific disorders (8,29,30)."
"For example, attempts at monitoring progress on effective treatments for mental disorders in the United States are often limited because of lack of adequate data sources."
"Treatment for ADHD or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been monitored using the National Survey of Children’s Health, and treatment for a major depressive episode (MDE) can be monitored with data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health; however, treatment for anxiety, behavior problems, and trauma have not been monitored in national surveillance efforts (31)."
"Challenges associated with surveillance of children’s mental health might include a separation among public health and mental health agencies at the federal, state, and local levels; stigma and privacy related to mental health data collection; and varying case definitions across surveillance systems (8,29)."
"Estimates from previous surveillance efforts and research studies indicate that approximately one in five children and adolescents experience a mental disorder each year (32,33); approximately two in five children and adolescents will meet criteria for a mental disorder by age 18 years (34,35), and one half of mental disorders have an onset before age 14 years (32)."
"Although children in all sociodemographic groups are affected by mental disorders, the prevalence of different disorders varies by the child’s sex, age, residence (e.g., urban versus rural areas), race or ethnicity, and other sociodemographic characteristics (8,33,34,36,37)."
"Prevalence estimates of diagnosed mental disorders have increased since 2000 for ADHD (38), anxiety (17), ASD (38), and depression (19)."
"Similarly, since 2000, symptoms of mental disorders and indicators of poor mental health, including reports by youths of feeling sad or hopeless, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts, as well as suicides among adolescents, have increased (39,40)."
"During 2011– 2019, suicide was the second leading cause of death among persons aged 10–29 years in the United States (41)."
A 2013 report described federal surveillance efforts that included measures of children’s mental health and mental disorders (8).
"The report identified gaps in children’s mental health surveillance, including the need for 1) standard case definitions of mental disorders to improve comparability and reliability of estimates across surveillance systems; 2) surveillance of mental disorders among preschool-age children; and 3) surveillance of anxiety disorders (overall and by specific type), bipolar disorder, and other mental disorders that occur less commonly in children."
"Since then, available information about children’s mental health has increased."
"For example, although the need for standard case definitions has not yet been systematically addressed, more attention has been paid to the mental health of preschool-age children (36,42–45) and the prevalence of anxiety in children (17,42), and understanding of the impact of health equity on the development and diagnosis of mental disorders has increased (2,37,46,47)."
"In addition to increased attention to mental health, prevalence estimates might reflect revised diagnostic criteria published in DSM-5 in 2013 (1)."
"Surveillance also might be affected by policy changes at the national and state levels regarding access to care, including the promotion of integrating primary and behavioral health services (48–50) and specific provisions for children with preexisting conditions (e.g., the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) (51–54)."
This report updates and expands the 2013 surveillance report on mental health among children (8).
"Similar to the 2013 report, this report provides an overview of nine federal surveillance systems that collect data related to children’s mental health in the United States and the most recent estimates (2013–2019) available from these systems, including estimates according to selected sociodemographic characteristics linked to social determinants of health, such as age, sex, race and ethnicity, economic resources, parent education, access to health insurance, and geographic classification (23)."
"In addition, whereas the 2013 report focused on national estimates of mental disorders and indicators of poor mental health among children, this report also includes data on 1) receipt of mental health services among children, 2) positive indicators of mental health, and 3) state-level estimates."
"First, this report includes data on receipt of mental health services among all children."
"These data are an indicator of the impact of mental disorders or symptoms of mental disorders on the service system, the costs associated with mental disorders, and access to specialized health services."
"Describing patterns of mental health services by subgroups might identify gaps in access to services or treatment for mental disorders and provide information to address health inequities (30,55,56)."
"Second, this report includes several positive indicators of mental health that are measured on a continuum to provide a more inclusive picture of children’s mental health status."
"Third, this report includes state-level estimates when possible."
"State estimates are important because they describe the heterogeneity of smaller geographic units, can reflect the results of state-level practices and policies, and provide actionable information for program planning and resource allocation at a more local level (57,58)."
"The findings in this report can be used by public health professionals, health care providers, state health officials, policymakers, and educators to understand the prevalence of specific mental disorders and other indicators of mental health and the challenges related to mental health surveillance."
"Methods Description of Surveillance Systems Nine data systems with indicators of children’s mental health were identified, including the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM), the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), the School-Associated Violent Death Surveillance System (SAVD-SS), and the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)."
"Each of the data systems was designed to address different objectives, and the systems vary in methods (e.g., in-person interview, online questionnaire, vital statistics data, and parent report or self-report)."
"Each system assesses different aspects of mental health, and the specific indicators included vary by survey; for example, although four systems include indicators of depression, the specific indicator is unique to each system."
"The data include persons ranging in age from 6 months to 19 years; although 17 years was the maximum age for most surveys, YRBS also included high school students aged ≥18 years, and data on suicides included persons aged 10–19 years for consistency with how these data are typically presented."
"Parents, guardians, and caregivers who answered survey questions as proxies for youths are collectively referred to as parents in this report."
"Following is a detailed description of the nine federal data systems and their associated data that are presented in this report, as well as a summary of each system (Tables 1 and 2)."
State-level ranges are presented when available; individual state prevalences are also available in the supplementary tables (Supplementary Tables 1–4; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113924).
The most recent data available at the time the report was written are described and presented.
Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network The ADDM Network is an active surveillance program conducted by CDC that provides estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 4–8 years whose parents or guardians live in geographically defined areas of the United States.
The ADDM Network has reported population-based estimates of ASD prevalence among children aged 8 years in even-numbered years since 2000.
The most recent data at the time the report was written are from 11 geographically diverse sites that conducted population-based ASD surveillance for 2016.
Surveillance is conducted in two phases.
The first phase involves review and abstraction of comprehensive evaluations that were completed by medical and educational service providers in the community.
"In the second phase, experienced clinicians systematically review all abstracted information to determine ASD case status."
The case definition is based on ASD criteria described in DSM-5 (1).
"Although not nationally representative, ASD prevalence estimates are available by site, and the sample size allows for estimation and comparisons of sociodemographic characteristics within each participating community."
"Although individual-level ADDM Network data are not publicly available, various site-level or group-level results are available (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm.html), and CDC has an interactive website that allows ADDM data to be visualized or downloaded along with other state-based sources of ASD prevalence data (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/ data/index.html)."
The results presented in this report are based on 2016 data.
"Among 275,409 children aged 8 years living in the geographically defined areas comprising the 11 sites, a total of 5,108 children were identified as having ASD."
"For other mental health indicators, the ADDM Network sites review children’s medical and educational evaluations and collect information on co-occurring diagnoses of mental disorders such as ADHD, anxiety, and depression among children with ASD."
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES is a continuous cross-sectional survey on health and nutrition conducted by CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ nhanes).
NHANES uses a multistage probability household sampling design to obtain nationally representative estimates of health indicators for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population of all ages.
"Since 2011, NHANES has oversampled Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian (Asian), and non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) persons to increase the reliability and precision of estimates for these subgroups."
"Data are collected through examination and assessments in a mobile examination center (MEC), as well as interviews in the home."
"Health indicators have included cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, environmental exposures, infectious diseases and vaccination, mental health, oral health, dietary intake, and supplement and prescription medication use (59)."
NHANES data are released in 2-year cycles.
"Most data are available online (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes); restricted data, such as depression symptoms for children and adolescents aged 12–17 years (collectively referred to as adolescents in this report), are available to researchers through the CDC Research Data Center (https://www.cdc.gov/rdc)."
"For this report, the data have been pooled for NHANES cycles 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018."
"The 2019–2020 NHANES cycle was not completed because of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the data for the cycle collected in 2019 through March 2020 have been combined with the prepandemic 2017–2018 data for future analysis; however, these data were not available for this report."
"Across these cycles, overall NHANES interview response rates ranged from 71.0% to 51.9%; MEC examination response rates ranged from 68.5% to 48.8%."
Response rates for adolescents and young adults aged 12–19 years were approximately 5 percentage points higher than the overall response rates in every cycle.
NHANES estimates for this report are based on data collected during the in-home interview and private in-person MEC interview.
"Since the 2005–2006 administration, NHANES has included the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to measure depression symptoms (60)."
The PHQ-9 screening instrument consists of nine questions about depression symptoms during the past 2 weeks followed by a single question that assesses associated impairment; the resulting scores are used to determine depression severity and range from 0 to 27 (60).
Adolescent self-reports on depression symptoms were collected during the MEC interview.
"The PHQ-9 has been estimated to have a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 77.5% for detecting adolescents who meet the DSM-IV (61) criteria for major depression on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version IV (DISC-IV) (62,63)."
"In this report, weighted estimates of depression are based on a score of ≥10 for adolescents aged 12–17 years who completed the MEC interview for NHANES during 2013–2018."
"In past NHANES cycles, other mental health assessments were administered to youths, such as diagnostic modules from DISC during 1999–2004 (64)."
National Health Interview Survey NHIS is a survey of a nationally representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population and is conducted continuously throughout the year by CDC to monitor the health of the U.S. popuation (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ nhis).
"NHIS is an in-person interview conducted in the respondent’s home; in some instances, a follow-up to complete the interview is conducted via telephone."
"For interviews completed during 1997–2018, families were identified within each sampled household, and a family member completed a brief questionnaire on selected demographic and broad health measures."
"From each family in the household, one adult and one child were randomly selected to receive a more detailed health questionnaire."
A parent answered questions for one randomly selected child or adolescent aged 0–17 years.
NHIS data are publicly available online (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ nhis); restricted data are available to researchers through the NCHS Research Data Center (https://www.cdc.gov/rdc).
"Data included in this report are pooled from the 2017 and 2018 surveys, which included 8,845 and 8,269 children and adolescents aged 0–17 years, respectively."
"The total household response rate was 66.5% in 2017 and 64.2% in 2018, and the final response rate for the sample child component was 60.6% in 2017 and 59.2% in 2018."
"NHIS has included questions on ASD and ADHD annually since 1997, with some changes in the ASD measure over time."
"For ADHD, parents were asked, “Has a doctor or health professional ever told you that [child] had attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or attention-deficit disorder (ADD)?” Since 2014, the ASD question wording has been consistently phrased as, “Has a doctor or health professional ever told you that [child] had autism, Asperger’s disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, or autism spectrum disorder?” Beginning in 2016, follow-up questions were added to determine current diagnoses: “Does [child] currently have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or attentiondeficit disorder (ADD)?” and “Does [child] currently have autism, Asperger’s disorder, pervasive developmental disorder, or autism spectrum disorder?” To assess use of mental health services, NHIS included the following question on mental health care consultations for emotional or behavioral problems: “During the past 12 months, have you seen or talked to any of the following health care providers about [child’s] health?"
"A mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, psychiatric nurse, or clinical social worker?” In addition, for those who reported having consulted with a general physician in the past 12 months, a follow-up question was used to address whether the physician was consulted specifically for emotional or behavioral problems: “Did you see or talk to this general doctor because of an emotional or behavioral problem that [child] may have?” The denominator included all children, regardless of whether they had consulted a general physician in the past 12 months."
"National Survey of Children’s Health NSCH is an annual, cross-sectional, address-based survey that collects information on the health and well-being of children and adolescents aged 0–17 years, as well as related health care, family, and community factors that can influence health (https://mchb.hrsa.gov/data-research/national-surveychildrens-health)."
"NSCH is funded and directed by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Maternal and Child Health Bureau (HRSA MCHB), with co-sponsorship from CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and others, and is conducted by the Census Bureau using both online and paper methods."
Data are collected from a parent in the household who is knowledgeable about the health and health care of one randomly selected child.
Data provide both national and state estimates on key measures of child health.
"The data are subject to error arising from various sources, including sampling and nonsampling errors."
"Additional general information is available (https://mchb.hrsa.gov/data/nationalsurveys), and NSCH data and questionnaires are publicly available online (https://mchb.hrsa.gov/data/national-surveys/ questionnaires-datasets-supporting-documents)."
"NSCH was redesigned for 2016, combining two previously separate HRSA MCHB quadrennial surveys, the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) and NSCH (66)."
"Because of changes in the mode of data collection and sampling frame, as well as adjustments to item wording as needed, estimates from the redesigned 2016 survey cannot be directly compared with those from earlier years, nor can trend analyses using data collected before and after 2016 be conducted (66)."
"Since 2016, NSCH data have been collected annually."
"A total of 50,212 questionnaires were completed for the 2016 NSCH, followed by 21,599 in 2017, 30,530 in 2018, and 29,433 in 2019."
"The overall weighted response rate was 40.7% in 2016, 37.4% in 2017, 43.1% in 2018, and 42.4% in 2019; the weighted interview completion rate (or the probability that a household that initiates the survey completes it) was 69.7%, 70.9%, 78.0%, and 79.5%, respectively."
Approximately 75% of questionnaires were completed online each year.
NSCH assesses and reports data on the presence of diagnosed mental health problems or conditions in children and adolescents aged 0–17 years.
"Parents were asked about 1) depression, 2) anxiety problems, 3) behavioral or conduct problems, 4) autism or ASD, 5) Tourette syndrome, and 6) attention-deficit disorder (ADD) or ADHD."
"For each condition, parents were asked whether they had ever been told by a doctor or other health care provider that their child had the condition and whether the child currently had the condition; for behavioral or conduct problems, parents also were asked to consider reports from educators, including teachers and school nurses."
"For children with current problems or conditions, parents were asked to rate the severity of their child’s condition as mild, moderate, or severe."
NSCH also assesses and reports data on receipt of mental health treatment among children and adolescents aged 0–17 years.
"Parents were asked whether their children received mental health treatment or counseling or took medications for a problem with emotions, concentration, or behavior."
Additional treatment indicators that were available from NSCH only for a selected subset of disorders such as medication or behavioral treatment specifically for ADHD and ASD were not included.
Data included in this report for diagnoses and treatment are from the 2016–2019 surveys.
"NSCH also includes parent responses to items that can be used as positive indicators of mental health (67,68)."
"For children aged 6 months–5 years, parents were asked how often the child 1) is affectionate and tender (labeled affection), 2) bounces back quickly when things do not go his or her way (labeled resilience), and 3) smiles and laughs a lot (labeled positivity)."
"For children and adolescents aged 6 months–17 years, parents were asked how often the child shows interest and curiosity in learning new things (labeled curiosity)."
"For children and adolescents aged 6–17 years, parents were asked how often the child 1) works to finish tasks that have been started (labeled persistence) and 2) stays calm and in control when faced with a challenge (labeled selfcontrol)."
"Beginning in 2018, response options for the positive indicators were always, usually, sometimes, and never."
Children were considered to meet the indicator criteria if the parent answered usually or always.
Data included in this report for positive indicators are from the 2018–2019 surveys.
"National Survey on Drug Use and Health NSDUH is the primary source of statistical information on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol and tobacco use, substance use disorders, MDEs, and receipt of mental health and substance use services among the civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged ≥12 years in the United States, all 50 states, and the District of Columbia (DC) (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/ nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health)."
"Conducted by the federal government since 1971 (annually since 1990), NSDUH is sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)."
"For the years analyzed, NSDUH collected data through in-person interviews of household residents, persons living in noninstitutional group settings, and civilians living on military bases."
NSDUH collects data using audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) for sensitive items in which respondents read or listen to questions through headphones and then enter their answers directly into an NSDUH laptop computer.
"NSDUH is a state and nationally representative survey with approximately 150,000 addresses screened and approximately 67,500 respondents interviewed each year."
Adolescents and young adults are oversampled.
"Additional general information about NSDUH is available (https://www.samhsa.gov/data/ data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health), and NSDUH data are publicly available online (https://www."
datafiles.samhsa.gov).
"In 2018, screening was completed at 141,879 addresses, and 67,791 completed interviews were obtained, including 16,852 interviews from adolescents aged 12–17 years."
"The weighted response rates were 73.3% for household screening, 66.6% for interviewing, and 48.8% overall (69)."
"In 2019, screening was completed at 148,023 addresses, and 67,625 completed interviews were obtained, including 16,894 interviews from adolescents aged 12–17 years."
"The weighted response rates were 70.5% for household screening, 64.9% for interviewing, and 45.8% overall (70)."
"NSDUH uses ACASI to assess whether adolescents aged 12–17 years ever experienced an MDE (i.e., lifetime MDE) as defined by DSM-IV (61) or experienced an MDE in the past year."
"Lifetime MDE is defined as ever having at least five or more of nine symptoms of depression in the same 2-week period, in which at least one of the symptoms was a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities."
"An adolescent was defined as having an MDE in the past year if they met all of the following criteria: 1) had ever had an MDE, as well as 2) had a period of time in the past 12 months when they felt depressed or lost interest or pleasure in daily activities for ≥2 weeks and 3) during this period of ≥2 weeks, they had some of the other problems they reported associated with ever having had an MDE."
"NSDUH collects data on substance use disorders and types of substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol use disorder and illicit drug use disorder) annually."
"In the 2018 and 2019 surveys, substance use disorder was defined as meeting the DSM-IV criteria for either dependence or abuse for alcohol or one or more illicit drug."
NSDUH also used DSM-IV dependence or abuse criteria to define alcohol use disorder and illicit drug use disorder (61).
Additional information on the criteria NSDUH uses for substance use disorders are available online (70).
"Illicit drug use disorder included dependence or abuse of one or more of the following illicit drugs: marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, methamphetamine, or prescription psychotherapeutic drugs that were misused (i.e., pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives)."
One clinical validation study compared the NSDUH instrument with the Pittsburgh Adolescent Alcohol Research Center’s Structured Clinical Interview (71).
"The level of agreement was fair to moderate overall, with sensitivity values of 81%–95% and specificity values of 48%–63% for substance abuse or dependence (71)."
"The 2006 NSDUH Reliability Study, which compared responses on interviews conducted 5–15 days apart, reported a Kappa value of 0.67 for illicit drug or alcohol use disorders and was 0.62 for illicit drug use disorders (72)."
The 2018 and 2019 NSDUH survey years included questions to estimate the use of mental health services among adolescents aged 12–17 years.
"In addition to asking about treatment for depression, the surveys also included questions about receipt of any services for emotional or behavioral problems not caused by substance use."
The NSDUH interview section on use of mental health services among youths asks adolescent respondents whether they received any treatment or counseling in the 12 months before the interview in specialty and nonspecialty settings.
Specialty mental health settings include services in outpatient or inpatient settings.
"Outpatient services include 1) a private therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, social worker, or counselor; 2) a mental health clinic or center; 3) a partial day hospital or day treatment program; or 4) an in-home therapist, counselor, or family preservation worker."
Inpatient or residential specialty mental health services in which adolescents stayed overnight or longer include services in a hospital or a residential treatment center.
"Nonspecialty mental health settings for adolescents include the education, general medical, juvenile justice, and child welfare settings."
National Violent Death Reporting System NVDRS is a population-based active surveillance system conducted by CDC to collect data on violent deaths that occur within participating states and territories (https://www.cdc.
gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nvdrs/index.html).
"For the purposes of NVDRS, violence is defined as the intentional use of threatened or actual physical force or power against a person, group, or community that causes or is likely to cause injury, death, psychological harm, developmental harm (e.g., arrested physical, mental, intellectual, emotional, or social development), or deprivation."
"Violent deaths include child maltreatment deaths, intimate partner homicides and other homicides, suicides, and legal intervention deaths (i.e., when a decedent is killed by a police officer or other person with specified legal authority to use deadly force) (73)."
Unintentional firearm injury deaths and deaths of undetermined intent also are included in the system.
States are required to begin entering all deaths into the online system within 4 months from the date the violent death occurred.
States then have an additional 14 months from the end of the calendar year in which the violent death occurred to complete each incident record.
Additional information on NVDRS is available (https://www.
cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nvdrs/index.html).
"NVDRS data collection began in 2003 with six participating states (Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia)."
"Seven additional states began data collection in 2004 (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin), three in 2005 (Kentucky, New Mexico, and Utah), two in 2010 (Ohio and Michigan), and 14 in 2015 (Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington)."
"Eight additional states (Alabama, California, Delaware, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, and West Virginia), DC, and Puerto Rico began data collection in 2017."
"California began collecting data in 2005 but ended data collection in 2009; in 2017, California collected NVDRS data from all three required sources (i.e., death certificates, coroner or medical examiner reports, and law enforcement reports) from four counties (Los Angeles, Sacramento, Shasta, and Siskiyou)."
"NVDRS received funding in 2018 for a nationwide expansion that included the remaining 10 states (Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming), which began data collection in 2019."
"CDC now provides NVDRS funding to all 50 states, DC, and Puerto Rico (74)."
State health departments or their bona fide agents manage the state violent death reporting systems and serve as the point of contact to collect information from the major data sources.
"NVDRS obtains data from multiple complementary data sources, including death certificates, medical examiner and coroner records, law enforcement reports, and toxicology reports."
"Individual-level data include manner of death, injury mechanism, whether the person involved in an incident was a victim, and circumstances, which are defined as the precipitating events that contributed to the fatal injury."
"Numerous types of circumstance data are collected for suicide in NVDRS, including factors such as mental health history and status (e.g., current depressed mood, current mental health problems, current treatment for mental health problems, whether treatment has ever been received for mental health problems, and history of suicide attempts), whether a decedent disclosed the intent to die by suicide, interpersonal conflicts, alcohol or other substance use, other addictions, and criminal acts."
"Short narratives are also written by abstractors, which provide more details about the incident, summarizing the sequence of events from the perspectives of the medical examiner or coroner and law enforcement."
"Aggregate counts, percentages, and crude rates are available for all deaths by abstractor-assigned manner of death."
"Because no sampling is involved, all identified violent deaths in states that meet the reporting criteria are included."
"Data for persons aged 10–19 years in 18 states during 2014–2018 are included in this report (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin)."
NVDRS data are publicly accessible through CDC’s Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS; https://www.cdc.
gov/injury/wisqars/nvdrs.html) (41).
Deidentified case-level data are also available by formal request to eligible researchers via access to the NVDRS Restricted Access Database (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nvdrs/ dataaccess.html).
"National Vital Statistics System Vital statistics mortality data from NVSS are a fundamental source of demographic, geographic, and cause-of-death information in the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ nvss/index.htm)."
"The data are used to present characteristics of persons who have died in the United States, understand leading causes of death, determine life expectancy, and compare the U.S. mortality data with those in other countries."
The NVSS mortality data include information on all deaths occurring within the United States annually and have been collected since 1900.
"Mortality data are collected from information reported on death certificates, which are completed by funeral directors (the demographic portion) and the attending physicians, medical examiners, or coroners (the medical portion)."
National data for vital statistics are provided through contracts between CDC’s NCHS and state vital registration systems that are legally responsible for the registration of deaths.
"Information on demographics, geographic details, and cause of death is provided for all decedents."
State- and county-level information is available by place of occurrence as well as place of residence.
"Causes of death, including suicide, are processed in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)."
"Data are available in various formats, including reports, downloadable data files (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm), restricted use data files (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/nvss-restricted-data.htm), and online query systems (https://wonder.cdc.gov)."
Data for persons aged 10–19 years for 2018–2019 are included in this report.
"School-Associated Violent Death Surveillance System SAVD-SS is maintained by CDC and was designed to monitor incidents of lethal violence, including suicides, homicides, and legal intervention deaths, that occur in and around school settings (https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/ youthviolence/schoolviolence/SAVD.html)."
Data on schoolassociated violent deaths (SAVDs) are available for 1994–2018.
Incidents are identified through a systematic media scan of computerized newspaper and broadcast media databases.
"SAVD-SS cases include incidents in which a death occurred 1) on the campus of a functioning U.S. public or private primary or secondary school, 2) while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or 3) while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event."
"Identified incidents are confirmed with local law enforcement or school officials familiar with the incident, and law enforcement reports are collected when possible."
"Incident, victim, and perpetrator characteristics (e.g., incident location, cause and manner of death, circumstances precipitating the incident, and firearm-related information for incidents involving firearms) are coded from law enforcement reports, interviews with law enforcement or school officials familiar with each incident, or articles published in the media when a reliable source is cited (i.e., a law enforcement or school official or judicial proceedings regarding the incident)."
"SAVD-SS also collects information about whether the victim and perpetrator had a suspected or diagnosed mental health condition, experienced suicidal ideation or had a history of suicide attempts, were using alcohol or substances at the time of death or regularly used alcohol or substances, and had been victimized or perpetrated violence in the past."
"Because SAVDs are relatively rare and SAVD-SS includes personally identifiable information, data are not made publicly available; however, aggregate data are reported every school year (July 1–June 1) in the U.S. Department of Education’s Annual Indicators of School Crime and Safety Report."
Additional information about SAVD-SS is available (https://www.cdc.gov/ violenceprevention/youthviolence/schoolviolence/SAVD.html).
This report provides data on school-associated suicides among persons aged 10–18 years during 2013–2018.
"Beginning in January 2021, SAVD-SS data from 2021 and later will be collected through CDC’s NVDRS and will be publicly available in 2023."
"National Youth Risk Behavior Survey The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors health behaviors and experiences among U.S. high school students that contribute to the leading causes of mortality, morbidity, and social problems among youths and adults (https://www.cdc.gov/yrbss)."
"The system includes a national YRBS, conducted by CDC, and separate state, tribal, territorial, and local school district school-based YRBSs."
"National YRBS data and data for many state, territorial, and local school districts are publicly available (https://www.cdc.gov/yrbss)."
"Since 1991, the national YRBS has been conducted biennially, using independent, three-stage cluster sample designs to produce representative samples of public and private high school students in grades 9–12 (primarily aged 14–18 years) in the 50 states and DC."
"Student participation in the YRBS is anonymous and voluntary, and local parental permission procedures are used."
Survey participants complete a self-administered pencil-and-paper questionnaire during a regular class period and record their responses on a computerscannable answer sheet.
"In 2019, the number of students in the sample was 13,677, the school response rate was 75%, the student response rate was 80%, and the overall response rate (the product of the school and student response rates) was 60%."
Indicators of mental health included in the national YRBS include persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness and suicide-related behaviors.
"To assess persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, students were asked if during the past 12 months, they had ever felt so sad or hopeless almost every day for ≥2 weeks in a row that they stopped doing some usual activities."
"To assess suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, students were asked if during the past 12 months they ever seriously considered attempting suicide, whether they made a plan about how they would attempt suicide, the number of times they had actually attempted suicide, and whether they had made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or an overdose that had to be treated by a physician or nurse."
"Although not included in this report, YRBS also monitors the prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; however, the questions are not designed to identify drug use disorders."
"These data and the prevalence of other health risk behaviors and experiences examined by the national YRBS and many state, territorial, and local school district YRBSs are publicly available (www.cdc.gov/yrbss)."
"Analysis Similar indicators from different surveillance systems are grouped together and described (Tables 3–13), using data from the most recent years available, as defined in previous sections."
Weighted prevalence estimates and 95% CIs were calculated overall and by sociodemographic characteristics for the population represented by each surveillance system.
No statistical tests were conducted.
"The 95% CIs were compared, and estimates with nonoverlapping CIs were considered to be significantly different."
This is an inherently conservative approach to the identification of differences between estimates and might not have detected certain significant differences that would have been identified using other methods.
"Most estimates included children and adolescents aged 3–17 years, although certain surveillance systems were limited to data on children and adolescents with a narrower age range (ADDM: 8 years; NSDUH: 12–17 years; and YRBS: high school students, primarily aged 14–18 years); indicators related to suicide include persons aged 10–19 years (NVDRS and NVSS) and 10–18 years (SAVD-SS), and NSCH included certain positive mental health indicators for children as young as age 6 months."
"Indicators of mental health services are presented as the estimated percentage of all children who received a particular mental health service (e.g., consultations or medication), rather than the percentage of children with a diagnosed disorder, to allow for more comparable estimates across surveillance systems."
Mental health services data are included from surveillance systems that also include prevalence of disorders.
(Data sources that only included treatment data without other indicators of mental health were not included.)
"Estimates by sociodemographic characteristics were calculated by age group, sex, race and ethnicity, household federal poverty level (FPL), highest level of education among parents, health insurance status, and geographic classification (urban/ suburban versus rural) as available and applicable within each surveillance system."
"Subgroup estimates by race and ethnicity were calculated for non-Hispanic White (White), non-Hispanic Black (Black), Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) children; for a limited number of indicators with sufficient sample size, estimates are presented for nonHispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) children and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander (NH/OPI) children."
Estimates for children in other racial and ethnic groups were not calculated because the sample sizes were too small to produce stable estimates and are not presented in the tables.
"Estimates by health insurance status are presented for children with any type of public health insurance, children with any private health insurance, and children with no health insurance."
Children with both public and private health insurance were represented in both subcategories.
The information used to indicate geographic classification differed among surveillance systems*; the urban/suburban subgroup consists of persons living in large metropolitan areas with a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population of ≥1 million and suburban areas including medium and small metropolitan areas with MSA populations of <1 million; the rural subgroup consists of those living in all other areas.
"Descriptions of mental disorders and mental health indicators are included in this report, as well as prevalence estimates of the disorders and indicators (including rates of suicide) among children and adolescents available from national surveillance systems."
State prevalence estimates and rates are provided when available.
"Overall prevalence estimates, including weighted population estimates of the number of U.S. children and adolescents with each disorder or indicator, are presented (Table 3); rates per 100,000 are presented for suicide."
NSCH 2016–2019 data indicated that ADHD (9.8%) and anxiety (9.4%) were the most common mental disorders among U.S. children and adolescents aged 3–17 years; NHIS 2017–2018 data indicated an estimate of 9.6% for ADHD.
"Among adolescents, data from NSDUH 2018–2019 data indicated that 15.1% of adolescents aged 12–17 years had an MDE in the past year, and YRBS 2019 data indicated that 36.7% of high school students aged primarily 14–18 years experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year."
"In addition, YRBS data indicated that during the past year, 18.8% of high school students had seriously considered attempting suicide, and 8.9% had attempted suicide one or more times."
"Approximately 10% (9.6%–10.1% across NSCH 2016–2019 survey years, NHIS 2017–2018 survey years, and NHANES 2013–2018 survey years) of U.S. children and adolescents aged 3–17 years received mental health services from a mental health professional in the past year, and 7.8% had taken medication because of difficulties with emotions, concentration, or behavior in the past year according to NSCH data."
"Approximately one fourth (25.9%) of adolescents aged 12–17 years reported receiving mental health services in the past year, according to selfreported responses from NSDUH."
Positive indicators of mental health were reported for at least three fourths of children aged 6 months–17 years.
"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are present in multiple contexts, such as at home, at school, or with friends, and cause significant impairment (1,75)."
"On the basis of the predominant symptoms at the time of diagnosis, children can be classified into one of the three following categories: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, or combined (75)."
"However, symptoms can change over time (76)."
"ADHD is associated with a substantial risk for educational and occupational failure, criminality, social disability, substance use, other mental disorders, injuries, illness, and lower life expectancy (77–79)."
Both the NSCH and NHIS questionnaires asked parents whether a health care provider had ever told them that their child had ADHD (ever ADHD) and whether the child currently had this condition (current ADHD).
"Data from the 2016–2019 survey years of NSCH indicate that among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years, parents reported that 9.8% had ever received a diagnosis of ADHD, and 8.7% currently had ADHD (Table 4)."
"These prevalence estimates were very similar to the results from the 2017 and 2018 survey years of NHIS (Table 4), which assessed the same age range using the same survey item, with prevalence estimates of 9.6% and 8.2%, respectively."
State prevalence estimates from NSCH of ever ADHD among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years ranged from 6.1% in California to 16.3% in Louisiana; prevalence estimates of current ADHD ranged from 5.3% in California to 14.4% in Mississippi (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113924).
"Data from both NSCH and NHIS indicated that the prevalence of ADHD was higher among older age groups, and boys had approximately double the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses compared with girls."
"Among racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic and Asian children had the lowest prevalence, whereas Black and White children had the highest prevalence."
"Certain socioeconomic indicators, specifically, being in the lowest household income category (≤200% FPL) and having public health insurance, were associated with higher prevalence of ADHD."
"Parent education level was also associated with ADHD prevalence, based on NSCH data; children who had a parent with more than a high school education had a lower ADHD prevalence than those who had a parent with a high school education."
The prevalence of ADHD among children whose parents had less than a high school education was similar to that among children who had a parent with more than a high school education; NHIS estimates of ADHD did not differ by parent education level.
"When examining prevalence by geographic classification, both NSCH and NHIS data indicated that a higher proportion of children in rural areas had ADHD compared with children in urban or suburban areas."
"Behavioral and Conduct Problems Problems with behavior and conduct (i.e., behavior problems) among children and adolescents are associated with risks for long-term problems, including educational and occupational failure, substance use, mental disorders, injury, violence, delinquency, and lower life expectancy (77,80)."
"Disruptive behaviors that cause conflict between a child and family members, peers, and authority figures can be diagnosed as disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder (1)."
"Oppositional, inappropriate, negative, or defiant behavior is often found in younger children (1)."
Conduct problems are often found in older children and are characterized by behavior focused on ignoring the rights of others and violating social norms and rules (1).
"NSCH was the only survey with a question that asked parents if a health care provider or educator (including teachers and school nurses) had ever told them that their child had behavioral or conduct problems, followed by a question on whether the child currently had this problem."
"Data from the 2016–2019 survey years of NSCH indicated that 8.9% of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years had ever received a diagnosis of behavior problems, and 7.0% had behavior problems at the time of the survey (Table 5)."
State prevalence estimates of ever having had behavior problems among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years ranged from 6.4% in California to 13.1% in Louisiana; estimates of current behavior problems ranged from 4.1% in California to 10.9% in Kentucky (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113924).
Children aged 6–11 years had higher prevalences of behavior problems than children who were aged 11 years.
"Similar to the estimates of ADHD, boys had more than twice the estimated prevalence of behavior problems compared with girls."
"Black children had the highest estimated prevalence of behavior problems, followed by White and Hispanic children, with the lowest estimates among Asian children."
"Regarding socioeconomic factors, the highest prevalence of behavior problems was among children in homes affected by poverty and among children with public health insurance; the prevalence of behavior problems was also higher among children with parents who had a high school education (only) compared with those with more than a high school education."
The prevalence of behavior problems was higher among children living in rural areas than among those in urban or suburban areas.
"Depression Depressive disorder is characterized by significant feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, with symptoms persisting on most days for a 2-week period (1)."
"Children and adolescents who have depression are at higher risk for other mental disorders and health conditions, as well as school problems, difficulty with social relationships, self-harm, and suicide (17,34)."
NSCH asked parents if a health care provider had ever told them that their child had depression and whether the child currently had the condition.
"NSDUH identified MDEs based on adolescent self-reports of depression symptoms, identifying ever having had an MDE and having had an MDE in the past year."
"For NHANES, adolescents reported on depression symptoms during the past 2 weeks."
"YRBS examined self-reported persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness among high school students, primarily aged 14–18 years."
"According to data from the 2016–2019 survey years of NSCH, an estimated 4.4% children and adolescents aged 3–17 years ever had diagnosed depression, and 3.4% had current depression (Table 6)."
Results from the 2018–2019 survey years of NSDUH indicated that 20.9% of adolescents aged 12–17 years ever had an MDE and 15.1% had an MDE in the past year.
"NHANES 2013–2018 data indicated that 5.8% of adolescents aged 12–17 years reported having major depression during the past 2 weeks, whereas YRBS 2019 data indicated that 36.7% of high school students aged primarily 14–18 years experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness during the past year."
"State prevalence estimates, based on NSCH data, of ever having been diagnosed with depression among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years ranged from 1.8% in Hawaii to 8.1% in Montana; estimates of current depression ranged from 1.4% in Hawaii to 6.6% in Montana (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; https://stacks.cdc."
gov/view/cdc/113924).
"On the basis of NSDUH data, the prevalence of ever having had an MDE among adolescents aged 12–17 years ranged from 13.1% in DC to 28.0% in Oregon."
"Similarly, the prevalence of past year MDEs among adolescents aged 12–17 years ranged from 9.8% in DC to 19.9% in New Mexico and Oregon (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2)."
YRBS state estimates are available online (https://yrbs-explorer.
services.cdc.gov).
"Parent-reported data from NSCH during the 2016–2019 survey years indicated that the prevalence of ever having had a diagnosis of depression increased with age, particularly in adolescence; the prevalence was 0.1% for children aged 3–5 years, 2.3% for children aged 6–11 years, and 8.6% for adolescents aged 12–17 years."
"Among adolescents aged 12–17 years, parents reported a prevalence of 6.5% for current depression, which is slightly higher than the NHANES (2013–2018) estimate of 5.8% for adolescent self-reported current depression symptoms but lower than estimates of ever having had an MDE (20.9%) and past year MDE (15.1%) based on 2018–2019 NSDUH data."
"Across all measures of depression, girls had higher a prevalence than boys, with estimates derived from adolescent self-report (2018–2019 NSDUH, 2013–2018 NHANES, and 2019 YRBS) approximately twice as high for girls as boys."
"Among racial and ethnic groups, patterns differed depending on the survey."
"The lowest prevalence of diagnosed depression was among Asian children and adolescents aged 3–17 years according to NSCH data; otherwise, few differences regarding diagnosis were observed among Hispanic, White, Black, or AI/AN children and adolescents."
Estimates of current depression among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years based on NSCH data were lower among Hispanic children and adolescents than among White children and adolescents; this difference was not observed with NHANES data for current depression among adolescents aged 12–17 years.
Prevalence estimates of MDE among adolescents aged 12–17 years based on NSDUH data were lower among Black adolescents than among Hispanic and White adolescents.
"YRBS data indicated that among high school students primarily aged 14–18 years, the prevalence of persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness was higher among Hispanic students than among Black, White, and Asian students."
The estimated percentages of AI/AN and NH/OPI students primarily aged 14–18 years with persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness were similar to the estimates for the other racial and ethnic groups.
"An association was found between household poverty level and prevalence of depression (NSCH 2016–2019 and NHANES 2013–2018), with the lowest prevalence of depression among children from households with the highest income level (>200% FPL)."
"However, NSDUH estimates of ever and past year MDE were higher for children from households with the highest income level (>200% FPL) compared with those at the lowest income level (≤100% FPL)."
"According to NSCH data, the prevalence of depression in children with any private health insurance or no health insurance was lower than the prevalence for children with any public health insurance; otherwise, estimates using NSDUH (2018–2019) and NHANES data on health insurance statuses did not differ."
NSCH data indicated that children from rural areas had a higher prevalence of diagnosed depression than those from other areas.
Depression indicators from the 2018–2019 NSDUH and the 2019 YRBS data indicated no differences by geographic classification.
"Anxiety Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive fears and worries that are developmentally inappropriate, persist for >6 months, are severe, and interfere with daily functioning (1)."
"Anxiety symptoms in childhood and adolescence might include clear fear or worry but can also include irritability, anger, and trouble sleeping, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, or stomachaches (1)."
"In addition to generalized anxiety, anxiety can also manifest as separation anxiety, panic disorder, or phobias."
"Children with anxiety disorders are at risk for other mental disorders and physical health conditions, as well as school problems and negative effects on family relationships (17,34,42)."
"Only NSCH asked parents whether a health care provider had ever told them that their child had anxiety problems, followed by a question on whether the child currently had anxiety."
"Results of the 2016–2019 survey years of NSCH showed that 9.4% of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years had ever received a diagnosis of anxiety problems, and 7.8% had anxiety problems at the time of the survey (Table 7)."
State prevalence estimates of ever having had anxiety problems among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years ranged from 5.1% in Hawaii to 17.3% in Maine; estimates of current anxiety ranged from 3.8% in Hawaii to 14.7% in Maine (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113924).
"The prevalence of ever having had anxiety problems increased with age, from 2.0% among children aged 3–5 years to 8.6% for those aged 6–11 years and 13.7% for those aged 12–17 years."
Estimates of anxiety for boys and girls were similar.
"The highest prevalence estimates among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years were observed among White children and adolescents, and the lowest were observed among Asian children and adolescents."
"Although no differences in the prevalence of ever having anxiety problems were found by parent education level, prevalence estimates of current anxiety among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years were higher among children and adolescents of parents with more than a high school education than among those with less than a high school education."
Prevalence estimates were highest for children and adolescents aged 3–17 years with public health insurance and lowest for those with no health insurance.
No differences were found by poverty level.
Prevalence estimates of anxiety among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years were slightly higher for children and adolescents living in rural areas than in urban areas.
"Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges."
"Symptoms include difficulties with communication, social interactions, restricted and repetitive behaviors, and adapting to change."
Intellectual ability can range from gifted to severely challenged (1).
"A diagnosis of ASD now encompasses several conditions that were previously diagnosed separately: autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and Asperger syndrome."
"The DSM-5, published in 2013, collectively described these conditions as ASD (1)."
"Children with ASD often experience significant functional impairment and are at risk for having other mental disorders and medical conditions, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and neurologic conditions that require treatment (81)."
"NSCH and NHIS surveys both asked parents if a health care provider had ever told them that their child had ASD, followed by a question asking whether the child currently had ASD."
The ADDM Network uses a records review to cumulatively assess ASD diagnoses and symptoms through age 8 years.
"Estimates of the overall prevalence of ASD among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years using 2016–2019 NSCH data were 3.1% and 2.9% for ever having had a diagnosis of ASD and having a current diagnosis of ASD, respectively (Table 8)."
"Estimates of ASD among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years from 2017– 2018 NHIS data were lower, at 2.4% and 2.0%, respectively."
State prevalence estimates of ever ASD among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years ranged from 1.5% in North Dakota to 4.5% in Delaware.
Estimates of current ASD ranged from 1.3% in North Dakota to 4.1% in Delaware (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113924).
Prevalence estimates of ASD from 2016–2019 NSCH data increased from ages 3–5 years to ≥6 years.
"Although differences showed similar patterns in 2017–2018 NHIS data (a survey with a smaller sample size), the differences were not significant."
The 1.9% estimate from 2016 ADDM Network data among children aged 8 years was lower than the 3.0% estimate of current ASD from NSCH data among children aged 6–11 years but similar to the 2.0% estimate from NHIS data among children aged 6–11 years.
"Across all data sources, ASD was more common in boys."
Prevalence estimates among different racial and ethnic groups varied among the surveys.
"Whereas the ADDM data showed that Hispanic children aged 8 years had a lower prevalence of ASD than White or Black children aged 8 years, estimates of current ASD among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years based on NSCH data were lower among Asian children compared with Hispanic children."
Other ASD estimates for children and adolescents aged 3–17 years from NSCH and NHIS data showed no differences among racial and ethnic groups.
"Regarding socioeconomic factors, NSCH data showed that children with public health insurance had the highest prevalence of ASD, and children and adolescents aged 3–17 years in families with the highest income level (>200% FPL) had the lowest prevalence of ASD; these differences were not observed in NHIS data."
Parent education level and geographic classification were not associated with significantly different prevalences of ASD in NSCH or NHIS data.
"Tourette Syndrome Tourette syndrome is a tic disorder characterized by the presence of both multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic, with tics occurring for at least 1 year to meet diagnostic criteria."
"Other tic disorders include persistent motor tic disorder, with motor tics present for at least 1 year, and persistent vocal tic disorder, with vocal tics present for at least 1 year."
Provisional tic disorder is used when any tics have been present for <1 year.
"Tics often begin in children aged 4–8 years, and approximately 80% have another co-occurring mental disorder, including ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, or depression (1,82)."
"Tourette syndrome is the only tic disorder included in national surveillance systems and is only included in the NSCH questionnaire, which asks parents whether a health care provider has ever told them that their child had Tourette syndrome, followed by a question on whether the child currently has Tourette syndrome."
"Data from the 2016–2019 survey years of NSCH indicate that 0.3% of children and adolescents aged 3–17 had ever received a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome, and 0.2% of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years had a current Tourette syndrome diagnosis (Table 9)."
"A Tourette syndrome diagnosis was more common in boys than girls; prevalence estimates were similar among various age groups, races/ethnicities (Hispanic and White), parent education levels, types of health insurance, household poverty level, and geographic classification."
"Because of the relatively small sample size of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years with Tourette syndrome, state prevalence estimates are not presented, and estimates for certain sociodemographic characteristics were suppressed because of cell sizes of < 20 (children aged 3–5 years, Black children, Asian children, children of parents with less than a high school education, and children with no health insurance)."
Substance Use Disorders Substance use is typically initiated during adolescence (83).
"Familial, social, and individual risk factors might lead to substance use and substance use disorders among youths (84)."
"The use of substances during adolescence has been linked to motor vehicle deaths, sexually transmitted infections, and other physical and mental health problems (84)."
"Substance use disorders are characterized by impairments caused by the recurrent use of alcohol or illicit drugs (or both), including health issues, disabilities, and failure to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home (85)."
Substance use disorders during the past year were assessed by NSDUH through adolescent self-report on use of and experiences related to use of alcohol and illicit drugs.
"During 2018–2019, an estimated 1 million adolescents aged 12–17 years met criteria for a past year substance use disorder (85) (Table 3)."
"Data from the 2018 and 2019 NSDUH indicated that an estimated 407,000 adolescents aged 12–17 years (1.6%) had an alcohol use disorder."
"Alcohol use disorder among adolescents aged 12–17 years varied by state, with prevalence estimates ranging from 0.9% in Delaware to 4.7% in Vermont."
"Approximately 788,000 (3.2%) adolescents aged 12–17 years had an illicit drug use disorder."
State prevalence estimates of an illicit drug disorder among adolescents aged 12–17 years ranged from 1.1% in Louisiana to 6.0% in Vermont.
More detailed information on substance use disorders by state is available (Supplementary Table 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/ cdc/113924).
Past year alcohol use was higher among adolescent girls aged 12–17 years (2.0%) than among adolescent boys aged 12–17 years (1.3%) (Table 10).
Overall substance use disorder (either alcohol or illicit drugs) was lower among Asian adolescents aged 12–17 years (2.0%) than among White (4.2%) and Hispanic (4.5%) adolescents aged 12–17 years.
Alcohol use disorder was lower among Asian and Black (both 0.5%) adolescents aged 12–17 years than among Hispanic (1.7%) and White (2.0%) adolescents aged 12–17 years; estimates among Asian and Hispanic adolescents did not differ.
A higher prevalence of illicit drug use disorder was reported by adolescents aged 12–17 years with public health insurance (3.6%) compared with those with private health insurance (2.8%).
The prevalence of substance use disorders was similar across poverty levels and geographic classifications.
Suicide Suicide is defined as a death caused by injuring oneself with the intent to die.
"Suicidal behavior is a public health problem (86) that can have lasting effects on persons, families, and communities associated with the decedent (87)."
"Suicide is usually the result of a combination of individual, relational, community, and societal factors that interact with one another over time (87)."
"For example, suicide is associated with violence victimization, such as child abuse and neglect, bullying, peer violence, and dating and sexual violence (88)."
Suicide does not always result from a mental disorder (78).
A study of circumstances surrounding suicides documented in NVDRS found that 54% of suicide decedents did not have a known mental health problem (86).
The number of deaths from suicides reflects only a small portion of the overall impact of suicidal behavior.
"Although suicide is a complex problem, it can be prevented by using a public health approach that reduces factors that increase suicide risk and increases factors that promote resilience (89)."
"Data on suicide among children and adolescents were available from NVSS 2018–2019, NVDRS 2014–2018, and SAVD-SS 2013–2019; data on suicidal ideation were available from YRBS 2019."
"Data from YRBS indicated that during the past year among U.S. high school students primarily aged 14–18 years, 18.8% seriously considered attempting suicide, 15.7% made a suicide plan, 8.9% attempted suicide one or more times, and 2.5% made a suicide attempt requiring medical treatment (Table 11)."
"On the basis of data from NVSS, with coverage of the entire United States in 2018 and 2019, a total of 5,744 (6.9 per 100,000) persons aged 10–19 years died by suicide; the corresponding number from NVDRS, with data from selected states and counties for 2014–2018, was 4,903 (7.0 per 100,000) suicides among persons aged 10–19 years."
"During January 2013–June 2019, SAVD-SS data included 85 suicides; of these, 47 (55.3%) occurred among persons aged 10–18 years, and the remaining 38 suicides (44.7%) involved persons aged ≥19 years."
"The number of school-associated suicides among persons aged 10–18 years fluctuated by year, ranging from four in the first 6 months of 2019 to 11 in 2013."
Seven (14.9%) of these suicides involved a known diagnosed or suspected mental health condition.
"NVSS data indicate that rates of suicide per 100,000 persons aged 10–19 years were the lowest in Massachusetts (2.8) and the highest in Alaska (27.3) (Supplementary Table 2; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/ cdc/113924)."
"YRBS 2019 data indicate that among high school students primarily aged 14–18 years, the prevalence of suicidal ideation (i.e., seriously considered attempting suicide and made a suicide plan), attempting suicide, and making a suicide attempt requiring medical treatment were more common among female than male high school students."
"The prevalence of seriously considering attempting suicide was higher among AI/AN students primarily aged 14–18 years compared with Hispanic, Black, and White students."
"Similarly, the estimated percentage of students who attempted suicide was higher among AI/AN students than among Hispanic, White, and Asian students, and the estimated percentage of students who made a suicide attempt requiring medical treatment was also higher among AI/AN students than White students, but not significantly different compared with Hispanic, Black, and Asian students."
"Both NVSS 2018–2019 and NVDRS 2014–2018 data indicated that suicide rate was higher among persons aged 15–19 years than among those aged 10–14 years and higher among boys than among girls, and the rate per 100,000 children and adolescents aged 10–19 years was highest for AI/AN students."
"The rate was also higher among White children and adolescents than among those in other racial and ethnic groups; however, the rates among White and Hispanic children based on NVDRS data did not differ."
"Mental Health Services Mental health services include the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental disorders."
"Options to treat mental disorders among children include psychological treatments as well as medication (75,90–92)."
"Effective treatments can vary by age of the child, type of diagnosis and co-occurring conditions, and other circumstances."
"Psychological treatments are typically delivered by mental health professionals, including psychologists, psychiatrists, or counselors, but also might involve training parents and teachers to deliver interventions to children (75,93)."
"Evidence-based psychological treatment can focus on the parent, child, or family and can be delivered individually or in groups (94)."
"Examples of effective treatment approaches include parent training in behavior management, which has been documented as effective for ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders, particularly for younger children (94,95); applied behavior analysis for ASD (93); cognitive-behavioral therapy for disruptive behavior disorders, depression, and anxiety (96–98); interpersonal psychotherapy for adolescents with depression (99); or behavior therapy targeted to specific skills, such as cognitivebehavioral intervention for tics (100) or organizational training for children with ADHD (101), among others."
"However, the treatment that children receive is often different from the originally developed and tested programs with proven effectiveness, and providers might vary in their use of strategies and degree of fidelity with evidence-based approaches (102)."
Medications might be prescribed by primary care providers and other licensed mental health providers (103).
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved medications for childhood mental disorders such as ADHD, depression, anxiety, and ASD; however, many medications for mental disorders are prescribed without specific FDA approval for use in children and without following standard care guidelines (104,105)."
Medication might be more effective if carefully titrated and used in combination with behavioral treatment (95).
"Indicators of mental health services were included in NHIS, NSCH, NHANES, and NSDUH."
NHIS and NSCH both included questions about receiving services from a mental health professional during the past 12 months.
"In addition, NHIS included a question about seeing a general physician because of an emotional or behavioral problem."
"Both NSCH and NHANES included questions about medication; NSCH asked about whether the child had taken any medication because of difficulties with emotions, concentration, or behavior during the past 12 months, whereas NHANES asked about use of psychotropic medication during the past 30 days."
NSDUH included questions about receipt of specialty and nonspecialty mental health services.
All estimates of mental health services were calculated for the population of children and were not restricted to children with diagnosed mental disorders.
"Regarding treatment, data from the 2016–2019 survey years of NSCH indicated that 10.1% of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years, regardless of diagnoses, received any treatment or counseling from a mental health professional during the past 12 months (Table 12)."
"Data from the 2017–2018 survey years of NHIS indicated that 9.6% of parents of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years had consulted with a mental health professional about the child’s health during the past 12 months, and 5.2% had consulted with a general physician about an emotional or behavioral problem of their child."
Data from the 2013–2018 NHANES indicated that 9.8% of parents of children aged 4–17 years had consulted with a mental health professional during the past 12 months.
Data from the 2018–2019 survey years of NSDUH indicate that 25.9% of adolescents aged 12–17 years reported receiving mental health services in the past year.
"Regarding medication, 2016–2019 NSCH data indicated that 7.8% of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years had taken medication because of difficulties with emotions, concentration, or behavior during the past 12 months, and 2013–2018 NHANES data indicated that 6.6% of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years had used a psychotropic medication during the past 30 days (Table 12)."
State prevalence estimates for mental health treatment from a health professional among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years based on 2016–2019 NSCH data ranged from 6.5% in Nevada to 15.6% in Montana (Supplementary Table 3; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113924).
NSDUH 2018–2019 data indicated that receipt of mental health services among adolescents aged 12–17 years ranged from 15.9% in Tennessee to 35.9% in Colorado.
NSCH 2016–2019 data indicated that the prevalence of using medications related to mental health in the past year among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years ranged from 3.7% in California and Nevada to 12.4% in Louisiana.
"Consultations with general health care providers and mental health professionals about emotional or behavioral problems, as well as use of medications for mental health problems, increased with age."
NHIS data from 2017–2018 for children and adolescents aged 3–17 years showed that boys were more likely than girls to have seen a mental health professional during the past 12 months and that parents of boys were more likely to have spoken with a doctor about a child’s emotional or behavioral problem.
NSCH 2016–2019 estimates of mental health treatment by a professional among boys aged 3–17 years (10.6%) and girls (9.6%) did not differ.
"However, NSDUH 2018–2019 data indicated that a higher proportion of adolescent girls aged 12–17 years received mental health services compared with adolescent boys."
"Data from both NSCH 2016–2019 and NHANES 2013–2018 showed that boys aged 3–17 years were more likely than girls to take medications related to mental health (i.e., for difficulties with emotions, concentration, or behavior or a psychotropic medication)."
"Across surveys (NSCH, NHIS, NSDUH, and NHANES), for each indicator of mental health services, White children had the highest estimated prevalence, whereas Asian children had the lowest estimated prevalence."
"NSCH data from 2016– 2019 for children and adolescents aged 3–17 years indicated that Hispanic children had a lower estimated prevalence of taking mental health-related medication than White and Black children; a similar pattern was indicated by NHANES 2013–2018 data for children and adolescents aged 3–17 years, although the estimates for Black and Hispanic children did not differ."
No consistent patterns were noted for mental health service variables by household poverty level.
"Children and adolescents aged 3–17 years (NHIS) or 4–17 years (NHANES) of parents with less than a high school education were less likely to have a mental health consultation with a professional than children of parents with more than a high school education; for NHANES, children of parents with a high school education were also less likely to have a mental health consultation with a professional than children of parents with a high school education."
"NHANES data indicated that children and adolescents aged 3–17 years of parents with less than a high school education were least likely to have used a psychotropic medication during the past 30 days; however, NSCH data did not reflect this difference, and the prevalence of other mental health service variables did not vary by parent education level."
"The prevalence of each indicator of mental health services was higher for children with public health insurance compared with children with private health insurance, although the prevalence estimates from NHANES for current medication did not differ."
"All prevalence estimates for mental health services were higher for children with health insurance versus with no health insurance, although the prevalence estimate from NHANES and NHIS for receiving mental health services among children with no health insurance did not differ from children with private health insurance; the estimate for a mental health consultation with a general physician in NHIS data also did not differ for children aged 3–17 years with private health insurance compared with those with no health insurance."
"NSCH data indicated that use of mental health–related medication among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years was higher among children and adolescents living in rural versus urban areas, whereas prevalence estimates of consulting with a mental health professional or with a general physician about mental health problems were similar among children and adolescents living in rural and urban areas."
"Positive Indicators of Mental Health Positive indicators of mental health are factors that are associated with good mental health, including emotional wellbeing, effective regulatory and coping skills, and supportive social relationships (67,68)."
"Understanding positive indicators of mental health can provide important information about characteristics of children, such as behaviors and skills, that can be promoted to improve overall outcomes, including mental health, physical health, social relationships, and education (4–7,67)."
"For example, positive socioemotional skills such as selfregulation and resilience can be enhanced through intervention and predict long-term positive outcomes (26,106)."
NSCH (2018–2019) assessed six positive indicators of mental health for children aged 6 months–17 years.
"Parents were asked to report how often their child exhibited certain behaviors, and responses were categorized as “usually or always” versus “sometimes or never.” Among children aged 6 months–5 years, 97.3% usually or always showed affection (i.e., were affectionate and tender), 89.8% usually or always showed resilience (i.e., bounced back quickly when things did not go their way), and 99% usually or always showed positivity (i.e., smiled and laughed a lot) (Table 13)."
"Among children aged 6 months–17 years, 91.3% usually or always showed curiosity (i.e., interest and curiosity in learning new things)."
"Among children aged 6–17 years, 84.5% usually or always showed persistence (i.e., worked to finish tasks after starting), and 76.8% usually or always showed self-control (i.e., stayed calm and in control when faced with a challenge)."
"Among children aged 6 months–5 years in every state, ≥90% were reported to show affection, ranging from 91.5% in Arizona to 99.4% in Colorado and North Carolina (Supplementary Table 4; https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/113924)."
The estimated prevalence of resilience among children aged 6 months–5 years ranged from 84.0% in Arizona to 96.1% in New Hampshire.
"Among children aged 6 months–5 years in every state, ≥96% were reported to show positivity."
The estimated prevalence of curiosity among children aged 6 months–17 years ranged from 87.0% in Oregon to 94.5% in Maryland.
Persistence among children aged 6–17 years ranged from 77.2% in Mississippi to 90.5% in New Jersey.
"Among children aged 6–17 years, the estimated prevalence of self-control ranged from 66.8% in West Virginia to 81.6% in New York."
The prevalence of positive indicators of mental health varied by sociodemographic characteristics.
"Prevalence of curiosity was higher among children aged 3–5 years and 6–11 years than among children aged 12–17 years, whereas the prevalence of self-control was higher among adolescents aged 12–17 years than among children aged 6–11 years."
"The percentage of girls who were reported to demonstrate curiosity, persistence, and self-control was higher than the corresponding percentage of boys."
No differences by race and ethnicity were found in the prevalence of affection or positivity for children aged 6 months–5 years.
"White children aged 6 months–5 years had a higher prevalence of resilience than Hispanic, Black, and Asian children; no differences were found between the other groups."
"White children aged 6 months–17 years had a higher prevalence of curiosity than Hispanic and Black children, and White and Asian children had a higher prevalence of persistence than Black children."
"Among the four groups studied, the highest prevalence of self-control among children aged 6–17 years was among Asian children."
"Children who had a parent with more than a high school education had higher parent-reported ratings on each of the positive mental health indicators than those whose parents had lower levels of education, although no difference was found in rates of affection and positivity among children whose parents had more than a high school education compared with those whose parents had less."
"Children with private health insurance had a higher estimated prevalence of each positive mental health indicator than children with public health insurance, except for positivity, which did not differ by health insurance status."
"For each of the other five indicators, children with no health insurance had prevalence estimates between or similar to those of children with private and public health insurance."
"A linear pattern was noted for poverty level; children living in households with the highest income level (>200% FPL) were most likely to demonstrate each indicator, except for positivity."
"Among the groups studied, the lowest prevalence of curiosity, persistence, and self-control was among children living in households with the lowest income level (≤100% FPL)."
Only one indicator varied by geographic classification; children living in urban areas had a higher estimated prevalence of self-control than those in rural areas.
"Discussion Surveillance of children’s mental health and mental disorders is a critical part of defining the overall public health impact, increasing awareness about mental health and mental disorders, and identifying potential needs for allocation of resources."
"Overall, no single, comprehensive surveillance system for children’s mental health in the United States exists, and no single indicator can be used either to define what constitutes mental health in children or to identify the number of children with a mental disorder."
"These data confirm the overall finding from the previous report (8), which is that mental disorders among children continue to be a substantial public health concern."
One finding from the surveillance systems that collect data on children’s mental health was that mental disorders can begin in early childhood.
"Approximately 2% of children aged 3–5 years had ever received a diagnosis of ADHD, anxiety, or ASD, according to parent-reported data from NHIS 2017–2018 and NSCH 2016–2019, and approximately 5% had ever received a diagnosis of behavior problems."
"In contrast, NSCH data indicated that most young children were reported to show affection and positivity."
"Across data sources, estimates of mental disorders (i.e., ADHD, depression, anxiety, ASD, and Tourette syndrome) and receipt of mental health services generally increased with age, although reports of behavior problems decreased among adolescents aged 12–17 years."
Suicide (2018–2019 NVSS and 2014–2018 NVDRS) was more common among older adolescents aged 15–19 years than children and younger adolescents aged 10–14 years.
"Although the positive indicator of curiosity decreased with age, the prevalence of persistence was similar among children in the age groups of 6–11 years and 12–17 years, and the prevalence of maintaining self-control was higher among adolescents aged 12–17 than among children aged 6–11 years."
These data show the advantage of surveillance systems that include mental health indicators for children of all ages because of their ability to detect differences by age.
"Mental disorders affect children across the range of sociodemographic characteristics; however, the prevalence varies by certain characteristics."
"Consistent with previous studies, boys had a higher prevalence than girls of ADHD, behavioral or conduct problems, ASD, Tourette syndrome, and rates of suicide (1,34,38,42,82,86), and girls had higher estimated prevalences of depression, suicidal ideation, and attempted suicide (1,34)."
"Girls also had a higher estimated prevalence of curiosity, persistence, and self-control than boys."
"Although previous studies have shown higher a prevalence of anxiety among females compared with males (1,34), previous estimates with NSCH data have shown no differences in anxiety by sex (17,42), similar to the results in this report."
"Although the reported prevalence of substance use and substance use disorders have tended to be higher in boys than girls (1,34), no differences by sex based on 2018–2019 NSDUH data were found for substance use disorder or illicit drug use disorder, and girls had a slightly higher estimated prevalence of past year alcohol use disorders than boys."
These findings are similar to findings based on 2010 NSDUH data (107).
"Other studies have shown that patterns of drug use by sex also differ by age group and type of drugs used as well as changing trends in the use of specific drugs (29,40,108)."
"Data from the 2016–2019 NSCH and 2017–2018 NHIS indicated that boys were more likely than girls to have had a mental health consultation or received medication for mental health problems, whereas NSDUH data indicated that more girls than boys reported receiving mental health services."
The prevalence of many mental disorders and indicators differed by race and ethnicity.
"Black and White children had the highest prevalence of ADHD, and Black children also had the highest prevalence of behavioral or conduct problems."
"Because evidence has shown that racial bias can result in certain behaviors among Black children being incorrectly interpreted as disruptive, this finding might represent overdiagnoses or misdiagnoses that are masking other forms of mental distress among Black children (21,22)."
"The findings that Black and White children had the highest prevalence of ADHD and that the estimates for these two groups were similar are different from findings from older studies, which found that White children had a higher prevalence of ADHD than children from other racial and ethnic groups."
"Recent studies have reported a higher prevalence of ADHD and of ADHD combined with a learning disability among Black children than among White children, suggesting that this association might be changing (36,38)."
"Similarly, previous studies based on NSCH data have reported a higher prevalence of Tourette syndrome among White children than among Hispanic and Black children (109), whereas 2016–2019 NSCH data in this report indicated a similar estimated prevalence of Tourette syndrome among White and Hispanic children."
"Although future years of data can be used to confirm whether these differences between White and Black children have persisted, these patterns, combined with the data on ADHD, suggest that diagnoses of these disorders might have increased among Black and Hispanic children in recent years, a finding that has also been noted for developmental disabilities (110)."
"White children had the highest estimated prevalence of anxiety, each indicator of mental health services use, and the positive indicator of resilience."
"YRBS 2019 data indicated that Hispanic and AI/AN high school students primarily aged 14–18 years had the highest prevalence of feeling sad and hopeless, although the NSCH 2016–2019 data indicated that the prevalence of diagnosed depression among Hispanic children and adolescents aged 3–17 years was similar to or lower than the prevalence among White children."
"Data from 2018–2019 NSDUH indicated a similar prevalence of MDE among Hispanic and White adolescents aged 12–17 years, with both groups having a higher prevalence of MDE than Black adolescents."
"Similarly, the NSDUH prevalence estimate of alcohol use disorder was higher among White adolescents than among Black and Asian adolescents; no significant differences by race and ethnicity were found for prevalence of illicit drug use disorder."
"Other studies have found that for numerous years, Black adolescents have reported substantially lower levels of illicit drug use than White and Hispanic adolescents; however, the difference has decreased in recent years (111)."
"Black adolescents aged 12–17 years had a lower prevalence of MDE than White adolescents based on NSDUH 2018–2019 data, whereas for other indicators of depression, including diagnosed depression among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years using 2016–2019 NSCH data, the prevalence was similar for Black and White children."
"Also based on NSCH data, Black children tended to have a lower prevalence of anxiety problems than White children, and the prevalence was more similar between Black and Hispanic children."
"Although the prevalence of receipt of mental health services was consistently lower across data sources (2016–2019 NSCH, 2017–2018 NHIS, 2018–2019 NSDUH, and 2013–2018 NHANES) for Black children compared with White children, the prevalence was only different for three of the mental health service indicators: mental health treatment by a professional (NSCH data), mental health consultation with a professional (NHIS data), and current medication for mental health problems (NHANES data)."
"Black children and children in other minority groups are at increased risk for poor mental health related to the known impact of structural and individual racism on mental health and access to services (20,112)."
"Because a substantial subset of Hispanic children in the United States are first- or second-generation immigrants (113), increased levels of depression in the Hispanic population might be related to migration stressors for first-generation youths (114), parental citizenship status (115), and cultural differences (116)."
"However, they also might be associated with experiences related to racism and bias against cultural minorities, such as bullying experiences (117,118)."
"At the same time, Hispanic children might be less likely than nonHispanic children to access mental health care services, which might result in lower rates of diagnosis (119)."
"Estimates of ASD by race and ethnicity varied by data source and time frame (e.g., current ASD versus ever receiving an ASD diagnosis)."
"Although Hispanic children had a higher prevalence of ever having received an ASD diagnosis and currently having ASD than Asian children based on 2016–2019 NSCH data, the estimate of ASD was higher for Asian children than Hispanic children based on 2016 ADDM Network data."
"Asian children had the lowest prevalence of ADHD, behavioral or conduct problems, depression (NSCH), anxiety, ASD (except for ADDM Network data, in which Hispanic children had the lowest prevalence), and receipt of mental health services and the highest prevalence of self-control."
"Previous studies have shown increased risk for poor mental health among Asian children (120,121), although findings have been mixed (122,123)."
"Research on Asian children is limited and might be complicated by other factors, including heterogeneity on factors such as cultural group, immigration status, socioeconomic status, or methodological factors such as sampling, sample size, and recruitment (47,120,121)."
"Data are even more limited for AI/AN and NH/OPI children; only data on suicide (from 2019 YRBS, 2018–2019 NVSS, and 2014–2018 NVDRS) and depression (from 2018–2019 NSDUH and 2019 YRBS) were included because the sample sizes for AI/ANs and NH/ OPIs were too limited to generate estimates from the other data systems."
"AI/AN persons have increased risk factors for poor mental health, a higher prevalence of mental disorders, and limited access to behavioral health care (124–126); therefore, surveillance that includes a sufficient number of AI/AN children would allow for better monitoring of the mental health of this population (124)."
"Additional data and analyses are needed to better understand differences between and within racial and ethnic groups, as well as which specific factors contribute such differences."
The findings in this report show an association between health disparities and a lack of economic resources with indicators of children’s mental health (2).
"Children living in households with the lowest income level (≤100% FPL) had the highest prevalence of ADHD, behavior or conduct problems, depression (NSCH and NHANES, lowest for NSDUH), and anxiety and tended to have the highest prevalence of use of mental health services (with the exception of the NHIS question about seeing a mental health professional, which did not vary by poverty level)."
"Conversely, children living in households with the highest income level (>200% FPL) tended to have a higher prevalence of the various positive mental health indicators and a lower prevalence of ASD."
"The prevalence of ADHD and behavior problems was lower among children with parents who had more than a high school education than among those whose parents’ highest level of education was high school, whereas anxiety and positive indicators of mental health were highest among children of parents with more than high school education."
"Children with public health insurance had a higher prevalence of ADHD, behavior problems, diagnosed depression, anxiety, ASD, and receipt of mental health services and a lower prevalence of five of the six positive mental health indicators (all except positivity)."
"Previous studies of the impact of geographic classification indicated that children living in rural areas have increased risk factors for poor mental health and barriers to accessing mental health services (37,127)."
"For example, children living in rural areas are more likely than children living in urban areas to have poor physical health, exhibit health risk behaviors, and live in communities with more adults who have poor mental health (37,128,129)."
"Data in this report show that children living in rural areas were more likely to have a diagnosis of ADHD, behavior problems, depression, and anxiety and were more likely to have used mental health–related medication than children living in urban areas."
No differences in use of other mental health services were found between children in urban versus rural areas.
"These findings are similar to those from previous studies showing that children in rural areas are more likely to use medication but might be less likely to receive behavioral treatment (127), which might be related to a shortage of mental health providers in rural areas (130)."
Limitations The findings in this report are subject to at least eight limitations.
"First, numerous gaps exist in surveillance of mental disorders and mental health among U.S. children, many of which were described in the 2013 report (8)."
"Existing surveillance covers a limited number of disorders and does not allow for estimates of many specific disorders that occur among children, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or bipolar disorder."
"Furthermore, the majority of surveillance systems rely on parent report of a previous diagnosis, which is influenced by access to health care to receive a diagnosis, the parent’s ability to recall the diagnosis and willingness to report the diagnosis, and the accuracy of the diagnosis itself."
Health care providers might differ in how they apply diagnostic criteria and distinguish among different diagnoses.
"Although anxiety is one of the most common mental disorders in children (34,131), only NSCH provides regular data on the prevalence of anxiety in U.S. children."
"Relying on parent reports of diagnoses can be particularly challenging with emotional disorders such as anxiety that might be better assessed by self-report, particularly among adolescents (132,133)."
Lack of data on anxiety in other surveys might limit understanding of this disorder in relation to other indicators such as suicidality and other youth risk behaviors.
"Second, data from these surveillance systems cannot be used to provide overall estimates of good or poor mental health."
"Data on positive indicators of mental health, which were only assessed in NSCH, are limited."
"Furthermore, of the positive indicators that were included, three were only available for children aged ≤5 years, two were available for children aged 6–17 years, and only one indicator (curiosity) was available for children aged 6 months–17 years."
"Although these items were developed to describe positive development, data are limited on whether these capture the intended constructs with sufficient breadth and depth (67,68)."
"In addition, whether the items favor positive attributes among White children is unknown, nor is whether these positive characteristics are more likely to be inherently identified among persons from higher socioeconomic groups."
"Specific factors related to positive indicators, such as child attachment to the parent (68), might require more in-depth assessment (134)."
"Finally, the only negative indicator of a mental health crisis that is routinely captured is suicidality; data on other forms of crises, such as need of emergency care for mental health, are important indicators but are not collected in population-based surveillance systems (135)."
This limits the ability to understand the full spectrum of mental health and of both diagnosed and undiagnosed mental disorders.
"Third, even when indicators of mental health and mental disorders are available, various factors limit the use of these data to understand differences in certain populations or to understand the complete context of mental health and mental disorders, including possible health disparities based on social determinants of health."
"In many cases, sample sizes are inadequate for description by racial and ethnic categories, by state, or by other specific indicators."
"For example, even with 4 years of NSCH data combined, estimates for Tourette syndrome among Black and Asian children and among children with parents who have lower education levels or children with no health insurance were not reliable and could not be included in this report."
"Furthermore, despite using larger data sets, only four racial and ethnic groups were consistently reported among the different surveys, limiting understanding of differences in mental health and mental disorders among other racial and ethnic groups or among subgroups of racial and ethnic groups, such as comparing persons in minority groups who have recently immigrated with those whose ancestors have lived in the United States for generations."
"In addition to differences in prevalence by sociodemographic characteristics, previous research has shown that mental disorders and poor mental health are more common in certain groups of children, including those with other disabilities and chronic health conditions (136), children affected by racism (20,137) and other adverse childhood experiences (138), and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) children (139)."
"NSCH collects information on disabilities, chronic conditions, and some adverse childhood experiences, including perceived racial discrimination, unstable relationships, and exposure to violence (140); thus, these associations can be explored in the future."
"Although some data systems (e.g., YRBS) collect information about LGBT status, too few systems collect these data to be included in this report."
"Collection of more data on health equity indicators, such as structural and individual racism, sexual orientation and gender identity, adverse experiences, and other sociodemographic characteristics related to social determinants of health (23), might highlight additional opportunities to promote health equity (24)."
"Fourth, surveillance estimates for mental health at the population level are not timely enough to monitor immediate changes in mental health of a population before, during, and after public health emergencies, such as hurricanes or the COVID-19 pandemic (141)."
"In response to COVID-19, the Household Pulse Survey was implemented quickly and included questions on adult mental health that were comparable to the NHIS questions (142)."
"Other surveys were developed that included questions on adult mental health (143,144), whereas fewer considered children’s mental health (145,146), and they lacked baseline data from before the COVID-19 pandemic for comparison."
"In an attempt to document changes in mental health related to the pandemic, the Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey asked participants, including parents and children (via self-report for those aged 9–18 years), to report on their mental health status before the pandemic (147)."
Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program allowed for near real-time estimates of mental health–related emergency department visits for both children and adults and comparisons with estimates before the COVID-19 pandemic.
"However, these data only include problems that resulted in a visit to an emergency department and therefore do not represent the mental health status of the entire population of children (135,148)."
"In public health emergencies, immediate actions are needed to protect children’s mental health; thus ongoing, timely surveillance might provide benchmark data for comparison with data collected during and after an event to guide response actions and resource management."
"Fifth, each surveillance system is designed for specific purposes and uses different methods, affecting the ability to compare estimates directly across systems or integrate findings across systems."
"For example, NSCH includes questions about diagnosed anxiety and depression but not specific questions about treatment for anxiety and depression."
"NHANES has data on use of specific psychotropic medications but not on diagnosis of anxiety or depression, which means that these factors cannot be compared."
"Different systems focus on different ages, use different methods for sampling and data collection, and include different indicators of mental health and mental disorders."
"In addition, other indicators vary across systems, including how geographic classification is defined, the availability of data for different racial and ethnic groups, and year of data collection."
"These differences limit the ability to determine how much of the variability in estimates is due to differences in survey methods, sociodemographic characteristics, and other unmeasured factors (e.g., clinical information and cultural context)."
"Sixth, the data collected in these systems are cross-sectional, focusing on point estimates of mental health and mental disorders, and only allow for estimations of association, not causation."
"Much of the data are based on parent or adolescent self-report, including report of health care provider diagnosis, and are subject to recall error and inaccurate or incomplete diagnoses and disparities in access to health care."
"Moreover, parent-reported data might be influenced by parent perspective and other factors, including parent mental health."
Cultural differences might also affect parent reporting; parents might differ in how they interpret or report on items such as whether a child currently has a condition or behavior.
"For example, determining whether racial and ethnic differences in child resilience, curiosity, and persistence are influenced by cultural differences in how the behaviors are interpreted is not possible."
"Stigma related to mental health might also influence parent and adolescent reporting and the likelihood of seeking care, a concern consistent with emerging evidence of potential negative effects of receiving an ADHD diagnosis on some children (149,150)."
"The data are subject to errors such as sampling and nonsampling errors, including measurement errors or nonresponse bias, although survey estimates are weighted for nonresponse."
"Seventh, the data presented in this report also are limited in scope and focus; data are collected at a single time point and do not represent information on trends in prevalence over time."
"Previous reports have used data from these systems to document increases in ADHD, ASD, anxiety, MDE, and suicidal behaviors (17,38–40,85,151)."
Monitoring changes in prevalence over time is critical to understanding the public health impact related to mental health and mental disorders.
All data included in this report were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic and do not reflect the impact of the pandemic on children’s mental health.
"Finally, the data are presented to show how specific sociodemographic characteristics are associated with specific mental disorders; however, the complexity of the relation between the characteristics and disorders is not adequately described."
"Specifically, disorders might vary by sex and age together, such that estimates of anxiety and depression are typically similar by sex in younger children but in adolescents are more common in girls than boys (17,152,153)."
"In addition, the presented data do not describe whether children had more than one disorder, which is common and has implications for health care needs and health outcomes (1,34,75)."
Socioeconomic indicators are likely to be highly correlated.
"For example, because public health insurance is linked to poverty, the protective effect of public health insurance for families with low economic resources might not be apparent unless income is considered."
"Moreover, because of the significant association of poverty and racial and ethnic minority status in the United States, additional research could examine the extent to which differences in rates of indicators experienced by different racial and ethnic groups persist when access to resources is considered or whether they are better explained by health disparities based on racial bias, by cultural differences, or by other factors."
"Similarly, additional research might help clarify the extent to which rural status represents structural inequities related to disparities in access to services and support or to lack of financial resources or is confounded by racial and ethnic differences and disparities (112,154)."
"These complex interactions are beyond the scope of this report, which provides a broad perspective on surveillance systems that provide information on children’s mental health."
"Current Efforts to Improve Surveillance of Children’s Mental Health Despite the identified challenges in surveillance related to children’s mental health, numerous efforts have been implemented and are underway to improve the availability of related data."
"As noted previously, the design and administration of NSCH has changed substantially since the 2013 report on this topic."
The goals and process of the redesign have been described elsewhere (66).
"Decreasing response rates, an increasing proportion of households without a landline telephone, and the desire to provide more timely data prompted HRSA MCHB to transition NSCH from an interviewer-assisted telephone survey conducted quadrennially to a self-administered annual survey using online and paperbased methods."
"Attempts were made to retain all content necessary to produce important estimates related to child health and well-being, including the survey items used for analyses presented in this report."
"However, whereas the questions remained the same, based on the results from mode effects and operational tests, HRSA MCHB has determined that making direct comparisons to data collected before 2016 is not possible."
HRSA MCHB is committed to the annual assessment of the NSCH indicators presented in this report.
"The annual administration of NSCH presents opportunities to continue testing the framing and wording of these existing items through regular cognitive and usability testing, as well as the assessment of new content on emergent and persistent mental, emotional, and behavioral problems among children and adolescents (e.g., disordered eating)."
"After 2016, NSCH added items to more specifically address positive child development in the preschool years using the Healthy and Ready to Learn indicators (155)."
"These indicators include two composites that are closely associated with mental health, self-regulation and social-emotional development, which might provide ways to identify groups of children who need additional support (155,156)."
"Finally, HRSA MCHB is exploring options to further investigate the specific challenges presented as a result of the COVID-19 public health crisis through NSCH."
NHIS was redesigned in 2019 to reduce the time required of respondents and to make the content more relevant to the data needs of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
"To reach these goals, the survey length was reduced by implementing rotating content with fixed periodicity alongside annual content."
"Rotating content on a fixed periodicity schedule allows for more content to be included over the long term; for data users, partners, and communities to be able to plan for data availability; and for a shorter interview for the respondent."
"A panel of technical experts in the field of children’s health convened, consisting of stakeholders representing federal government as well as academic and public health researchers, and identified the enhancement of content related to children’s mental health as a priority for the redesigned NHIS."
"As such, mental health assessment, specifically the full Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and impact questions, and mental health care use, which includes use of medication, receipt of services, and reduced access to mental health care due to cost, will be measured on a rotating basis."
"In addition, beginning in 2019, selected stressful life events and expanded social determinants of health were added to the survey, which are useful measures to assess in conjunction with mental health measures."
"The Baby Pediatric Symptom Checklist, a 12-item validated screening tool, was added to NHIS annual core to assess social and emotional difficulties among children aged 0–23 months (157)."
"Also, in 2019, the Washington Group/UNICEF Module on Child Functioning (158–160) was added to NHIS to measure functional limitations in children aged 2–17 years annually; NHANES has included some of the questions for children aged 5–17 years since 2019."
(Data for the 2019–2020 cycle were insufficient to generate nationally representative estimates and will only be available for analysis without sample weights.
"Therefore, nationally representative data might not be available for these indicators until the 2021–2022 data have been collected and released.)"
"The questions ask about a range of functional limitations, including the child’s level of difficulty concentrating, ability to accept changes in routine, and ability to make friends, as well as the frequency of experiencing anxiety and depression among children aged 5–17 years."
The new NHIS design allows for the inclusion of emerging public health topics.
More information on the periodicity of NHIS content is available online (https:// www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/Sample-Child-QuestionnaireSummary-508.pdf).
"Future reports from the ADDM Network will use revised methods to produce more timely and efficient reporting of ASD prevalence, progress toward early identification, and the transition of adolescents with ASD to adulthood."
"ADDM will continue to incorporate chart review; however, ASD ascertainment will reflect ASD diagnoses or classifications from various medical, educational, and service providers in each participating community."
"An analysis comparing the previous and new case definitions showed the two produced similar ASD prevalence estimates, and other indicators were essentially unchanged (161)."
"The changes enabled ADDM sites to incorporate a wider range of data sources (such as state Medicaid programs), allowed for expanded tracking of early ASD identification among children aged 4 years, and allowed sites to begin reporting on the medical issues, mental health issues, and challenges with the transition to adulthood among children aged 16 years with ASD."
"Several ADDM sites are also piloting an approach to provide rapid statewide reporting of ASD prevalence, which could provide basic indicators of disparities in services or regional variations in ASD identification practices."
Additional indicators of mental health that address the continuum of good to poor mental health are also being added to surveys.
Some states and local education agencies have added questions to their YRBS that address protective factors.
"For example, some YRBS questionnaires include a question about who respondents would talk to if they felt sad, empty, hopeless, angry, or anxious; a question about whether they feel safe and secure in their neighborhood; and a question about whether they feel connected to their school."
NSDUH includes questions that ask adolescents whether they have persons they can turn to when they have a serious problem.
"Improving overall well-being, in addition to improving health, has been identified as an overarching objective for Healthy People 2030, the goal for the nation’s health in the United States (46)."
"In addition to the national surveillance efforts described, other activities have been conducted to understand the public health impact of children’s mental health and mental disorders since the previous report."
"The Project to Learn About Youth Mental Health (PLAY-MH), a community-based epidemiologic study, examined symptoms of mental disorders in school-aged children and adolescents in four different U.S. school districts during 2014–2018 (131)."
"On the basis of data collected from teachers and parents on children’s symptoms and impairments, approximately one in six students met DSM-IV criteria for having a childhood mental disorder, including anxiety disorders (7.9%–11.2% across sites), oppositional defiant disorder (5.7%–17.3%), and ADHD (5.1%–9.4%) (131)."
"The PLAY-MH study offers complementary data on both diagnosed and undiagnosed mental disorders among school-aged children (i.e., kindergarten through 12th grade) in the four participating communities."
"To help address the problems inherent in relying on nationallevel data to guide state and local decision-making, CDC is examining the constraints and value of applying small-area data estimation methods to the NSCH items on mental disorders."
"Such methods have been applied to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (i.e., CDC’s PLACES project; https:// www.cdc.gov/places) to provide local estimates for adult data, and to other content areas in NSCH (162)."
"In addition, HRSA MCHB and the Census Bureau offer the opportunity for states to sponsor oversampling of specific populations at the statewide or substate levels to support more targeted assessment, program planning and evaluation to aid in state and local decisionmaking (163)."
"YRBSS allows for state, tribal, territorial, and local school district data."
"Although CDC conducts a national YRBS (with data presented in this report), CDC provides these sites with technical assistance on surveys and quality assurance oversight allowing for site-specific YRBS data for use by education and health agencies (164)."
These combined efforts could provide more precise local estimates of children’s mental disorders and increase the value of the data obtained via investments in NSCH.
"CDC efforts are focused on the longer-term goal of building state and local capacity to collect, analyze, and use surveillance data on children’s mental health to monitor population health and connect more families with effective mental health services."
"Through two cooperative agreements, CDC is developing tools to assist state and local stakeholders in their efforts to support children’s mental health."
A CDC-supported resource released in May 2020 by the National Network of Public Health Institutes (Data Governance for Children’s Mental Health Surveillance: What Is It and Why Does it Matter?)
detailed the specific data governance challenges in working with children’s mental health data (165).
"In July 2020, the Public Health Informatics Institute of the Task Force for Global Health released a CDC-supported summary of laws related to child mental health data collection, sharing, and use (166)."
"In October 2021, the Public Health Informatics Institute released a playbook to guide the planning and implementation of a child and adolescent mental health surveillance program using existing data sources (167)."
Tools continue to be developed to assist state and local systems to collect and use data to improve children’s mental health.
"Future Directions and Public Health Implications The findings in this report can be used by public health professionals, health care providers, state health officials, policymakers, and educators to understand the prevalence of specific mental disorders and other indicators of mental health and the challenges related to mental health surveillance."
"Because of the substantial impact of children’s mental health on the development, overall health, and well-being of children (4,10–12,15,16), surveillance data to monitor children’s mental health, such as data on differences by sociodemographic characteristics and disability status, issues related to health equity, changes over time, and the relation to public health emergencies, are critical for directing resources to support children and families, including by identifying mental health workforce provider shortages."
Current data sources provide information on both diagnosis and treatment but do not indicate whether children and families are receiving adequate or evidence-based treatment.
Improved surveillance can be used to move beyond point-in-time prevalence to identify how well children are doing and when they need support and to cover the entire continuum of children’s mental health and functioning from birth through adolescence.
Improved surveillance would also go beyond focusing on diagnoses and would include measures of healthy development and resilience as well as symptoms of mental disorders (67).
"In addition to providing information at the national level, more timely surveillance of children’s mental health would provide data that are actionable at state and local levels."
A comprehensive public health approach to surveillance would assess policies and programs that support mental health before a diagnosis is needed (2).
"More comprehensive surveillance could help identify which mental health services, including treatment and prevention efforts, are needed and would be most effective for children with varying disorders, risk and protective factors, and circumstances so that public health interventions can be tailored to promote all children’s mental health."
Identifying and addressing structural and systemic factors are critical to promoting health equity.
"Conclusion Mental health and well-being are important indicators for public health and have been identified as an important component of improving the nation’s health overall and health equity (46,168)."
"Although current data sources and measures provide some information on specific disorders and indicators of mental health, the data are not sufficient to provide a comprehensive description of children’s mental health in the United States (46)."
"However, the surveillance systems reviewed in this report provide useful and actionable information on the status of several children’s mental health indicators."
"In addition, this report highlights the importance of ongoing surveillance of children’s mental health to help identify which resources are needed to support children and to evaluate progress associated with efforts to improve children’s mental health."

Mental Health and Well-Being of
University Students: A Bibliometric
Mapping of the Literature
""
"The purpose of this study is to map the literature on mental health and well-being of university students using metadata extracted from 5,561 journal articles indexed in the Web of Science database for the period 1975–2020."
"More specifically, this study uses bibliometric procedures to describe and visually represent the available literature on mental health and well-being in university students in terms of the growth trajectory, productivity, social structure, intellectual structure, and conceptual structure of the field over 45 years."
"Key findings of the study are that research on mental health and well- being in university students: (a) has experienced a steady growth over the last decades, especially since 2010; (b) is disseminated in a wide range of journals, mainly in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and education research; (c) is published by scholars with diverse geographical background, although more than half of the publications are produced in the United States; (d) lies on a fragmented research community composed by multiple research groups with little interactions between them; (e) is relatively interdisciplinary and emerges from the convergence of research conducted in the behavioral and biomedical sciences; (f) tends to emphasize pathogenic approaches to mental health (i.e., mental illness); and (g) has mainly addressed seven research topics over the last 45 years: positive mental health, mental disorders, substance abuse, counseling, stigma, stress, and mental health measurement."
"The findings are discussed, and the implications for the future development of the field are highlighted."
INTRODUCTION
The entrance to the university marks a period of transition for young people.
"Through this transition, students face new challenges, such as making independent decisions about their lives and studies, adjusting to the academic demands of an ill-structured learning environment, and interacting with a diverse range of new people."
"In addition, many students must, often for the first time, leave their homes and distance themselves from their support networks (Cleary et al., 2011)."
These challenges can affect the mental health and well-being of higher education students.
"Indeed, there is evidence that a strain on mental health is placed on students once they start at the university, and although it decreases throughout their studies (Macaskill, 2013; Mey and Yin, 2015), it does not return to pre-university levels (Cooke et al., 2006; Bewick et al., 2010)."
"Also, the probabilities of experiencing common psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, and stress, increase throughout adolescence and reach a peak in early adulthood around age 25 (Kessler et al., 2007) which makes university students a particularly vulnerable population."
The interest in mental health and well-being in university students has grown exponentially in the last decades.
This is likely due to three interrelated challenges.
"First, although university students report levels of mental health similar to their non- university counterparts (Blanco et al., 2008), recent studies suggest an increase and severity of mental problems and help- seeking behaviors in university students around the world in the last decade (Wong et al., 2006; Hunt and Eisenberg, 2010; Verger et al., 2010; Auerbach et al., 2018; Lipson et al., 2019)."
"Some researchers refer to these trends as an emerging “mental health crisis” in higher education (Kadison and DiGeronimo, 2004; Evans et al., 2018)."
"Second, psychological distress in early adulthood is associated with adverse short-term outcomes, such as poor college attendance, performance, engagement, and completion (e.g., King et al., 2006; Antaramian, 2015), and others in the long term, such as dysfunctional relationship (Kerr and Capaldi, 2011), recurrent mental health problems, university dropout, lower rates of employment, and reduced personal income (Fergusson et al., 2007)."
"Third, there is a widespread agreement that higher education institutions offer unique opportunities to promote the mental health and well- being of young adults as they provide a single integrated setting that encompasses academic, professional, and social activities, along with health services and other support services (Eisenberg et al., 2009; Hunt and Eisenberg, 2010)."
"However, the majority of university students experiencing mental health problems and low levels of well-being are not receiving treatment (Blanco et al., 2008; Eisenberg et al., 2011; Lipson et al., 2019) and, while universities continue to expand, there is a growing concern that the services available to provide support to students are not developing at an equivalent rate (Davy et al., 2012)."
"In response to the increasing volume of research on the mental health and well-being of university students, there have been several attempts to synthesize the accumulating knowledge in the field and to provide an illustration of the theoretical core and structure of the field using traditional content analysis of the literature (e.g., Kessler et al., 2007; Gulliver et al., 2010; Hunt and Eisenberg, 2010; Sharp and Theiler, 2018)."
This study aims to extend the understanding of mental health in university students by providing a bird’s eye view of the research conducted in this field in recent decades using a bibliometric approach.
"Bibliometric overviews provide an objective and systematic approach to discover knowledge flows and patterns in the structure of a field (Van Raan, 2014) reveal its scientific roots, identify emerging thematic areas and gaps in the literature (Skute et al., 2019) and, ultimately, contribute to moving the field forward."
"Accordingly, this study employs several bibliometric indicators to explore the evolution of the field based on publication and citation trends, key actors and venues contributing to the advancement of research on mental health and well-being of university students, and the structure"
"of the field in terms of patterns of scientific collaborations, disciplines underlying the foundations of the field, and recurrent research themes explored in the literature."
"This is important because, despite significant advances in the field, research on mental health and well-being remains a diverse and fragmented body of knowledge (Pellmar and Eisenberg, 2000; Bailey, 2012; Wittchen et al., 2014a)."
"Indeed, mental health and well-being are nebulous concepts and their history and development are quite intricate, with a multitude of perspectives and contributions emerging from various disciplines and contexts (see section “Conceptualization of Mental Health, Mental Illness, and Well- Being: An Overview”)."
"Therefore, mapping research on mental health and well-being in university students is essential to identify contributions and challenges to the development of the field, to help guide policy, research, and practice toward areas, domains, populations, and contexts that should be further explored, and to provide better care of students at higher education institutions (Naveed et al., 2017)."
"CONCEPTUALIZATION OF MENTAL HEALTH, MENTAL ILLNESS, AND WELL-BEING: AN OVERVIEW"
"This section provides an overview of the different perspectives adopted in the literature to conceptualize mental health, well- being, and other relevant constructs in order to identify the glossary of key terms that will be used in the search strategy to create a comprehensive corpus of documents on mental health and well-being in university students for this bibliometric review."
Perspectives on Mental Health and
Mental Illness
There is no general agreement on the definition of mental health.
"For a long time, the term mental health has been used as a euphemism for mental illness (Manwell et al., 2015)."
"However, mental health and mental illness are regarded as distinct constructs nowadays and two main perspectives differentiating between mental health and illness are available in the literature."
The continuum approach considers that mental health and mental illness are the two opposite poles of a continuum.
"Thus, there are various degrees of health and illness between these poles, with most of us falling somewhere in between."
"The categorical approach, on the other hand, represents mental health and illness as a dichotomy."
"People who manifest mental illness symptoms would belong to that category and labeled correspondingly, while those absent of these symptoms can be considered as mentally healthy (Scheid and Brown, 2010)."
Disciplinary Approaches to the Conceptualization of Mental Health/Illness
Conceptualizations of mental health/illness are largely dependent on the theoretical and paradigmatic foundations of the disciplines from which they emerge.
"In this context, the field has progressively evolved through the accumulation of knowledge generated in a diverse range of disciplines in the biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences."
"Biomedical disciplines are grounded in the medical paradigm focused on disease and (ab)normality and often emphasize dichotomous conceptions of mental health/illness (Scheid and Brown, 2010)."
"Research on mental health and well-being in this domain has been traditionally conducted from a psychiatric perspective, which aims to understand the dysfunctionality in the brain that leads to psychiatric symptoms and to also offer a pharmacological treatment to correct neuronal dysfunctions."
"Consequently, psychiatrists have historically considered mental health as a disease of the brain (e.g., depression), similar to any other physical disease, caused by genetic, biological, or neurological factors (Schwartz and Corcoran, 2010)."
"While the prevalence of psychiatric approaches to mental health is currently incontestable, the development of other biomedical disciplines has tremendously contributed to the progression of the field in recent decades."
"For example, Insel and Wang (2010) argue that insights gained from genetics and neuroscience contribute to the reconceptualization of “the disorders of the mind as disorders of the brain and thereby transform the practice of psychiatry.” (1979)."
"In addition to that, other disciplines such as behavioral medicine have made important contributions to the field, although it has recently argued that mental health and behavioral medicine should be as two separate fields (Dekker et al., 2017)."
"Within the behavioral sciences, the study of mental health focuses on the distinct psychological processes and mechanisms that prompt thoughts, feelings, and behaviors (Peterson, 2010)."
"Clinical psychology has the longest tradition in the psychological study of mental health and tends to focus on the assessment and treatment of mental illness and disorders that can alleviate psychological distress or promote positive states of being (Haslam and Lusher, 2011)."
"However, significant contributions to the field have also emerged from other branches of psychology less focused on psychopathology, including personality and social psychology, psychoanalysis, humanistic psychology, and cognitive psychology (Peterson, 2010)."
"Despite the diversity of theories, principles, and methodological approaches to understanding mental health within the behavioral sciences, these disciplines acknowledge that mental health have a biological basis and reside in the social context, and tend to prioritize continuum approaches to mental health (Scheid and Brown, 2010)."
"Perspectives from the social sciences complement the biomedical and behavioral approaches by considering the influence of social and cultural environments in mental health/illness (Horwitz, 2010)."
"For example, sociologists are interested in how social circumstances (e.g., level of support available) affect levels of mental health/illness and how social structures shape the understanding and response to mental health issues [see Compton and Shim (2015) for an overview of the social determinants of mental health]."
"Similarly, medical anthropologists attend to the mental health beliefs and practices that form the cultural repertory within and across populations (Foster, 1975)."
"Beyond sociology and anthropology, social researchers in the fields of business and economics, family and ethnic studies, and educational research have also played"
a key role in advancing research on mental health in differentdirections.
The Importance of the Context in Mental Health
"Certainly, most notions of mental health/illness in the literature derive from prevailing psychiatric and psychological traditions developed in Western countries (Gopalkrishnan, 2018)."
"However, cultural values and traditions do shape how mental health and mental illness are conceptualized across contexts (Vaillant, 2012)."
"In this regard, Eshun and Gurung (2009) pointed out that “culture influences how individuals manifest symptoms, communicate their symptoms, cope with psychological challenges, and their willingness to seek treatment.” (4)."
Fernando (2019) argued that issues related to the ‘mind’ developed and are often interpreted very differently in non-Western and Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs).
"For example, cultures explain the manifestation of certain feelings and behaviors based on a range of motives including biological, psychological, social, religious, spiritual, supernatural, and cosmic."
"Failure to acknowledge alternative non-Western approaches to mental health and mental illness has resulted in imbalances of knowledge exchange and the permeation of dominating Western narratives into LMICs (i.e., so-called medical imperialism) (Timimi, 2010; Summerfield, 2013)."
"To address this issue, scholars have advocated for a greater willingness to embrace pluralism in the conceptualization of mental health and illness, which might help people to engage with particular forms of support that they deem to be appropriate for them, and to explore how knowledge and practices developed in LMICs can benefit those living in higher-income countries (i.e., knowledge “counterflow”) (see White et al., 2014)."
Prioritizing Positive Mental Health: The Science of Well-Being
"Despite the diversity of disciplinary and contextual approaches to mental health, current definitions of mental health have two things in common."
"First, mental health is considered from a biopsychosocial point of view that incorporates biological, psychological, and social factors."
"Second, mental health implies something beyond the absence of mental illness (e.g., Bhugra et al., 2013; Galderisi et al., 2015)."
"An example is the definition by the World Health Organization which refers to mental health as “a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community” (World Health Organization, 2004)."
"This definition contributed to substantial progress in research and practice in the field as it expanded the notion of mental health beyond the absence of mental illness and integrated the presence of positive features (Galderisi et al., 2015)."
"Research on positive mental health is relatively new but has grown rapidly in the last decades fueled by advocates of positive medicine and psychology, who have argued for a change of paradigm from medical and psychopathological-oriented models of mental health that focus on disorders and illness toward more strength-based approaches, which pay more attention to what is right about people and positive attributes and assets (Kobau et al., 2011)."
"In this regard, the term mental well- being has been progressively incorporated into the study of mental health to account for the positive aspects of mental health beyond the absence of negative factors."
"While there is not a universally accepted definition of well-being, two perspectives have dominated the discourses on well-being in the literature: subjective well-being (SBW) and psychological well-being (PWB)."
"SWB is based on hedonic perspectives of pleasure and represents “people’s beliefs and feelings that they are living a desirable and rewarding life” (Diener, 2012)."
"SBW is strongly linked with the idea of happiness and is typically understood as the personal experience of high levels of positive affect, low levels of negative affect, and high satisfaction with one’s life (Deci and Ryan, 2008)."
"PWB is grounded in Aristotelian ideas about eudaimonia, i.e., self-realization, with the ultimate aim in life being to strive to realize one’s true potential (Ryff and Singer, 2008)."
"PWB has been broadly defined as a state of positive psychological functioning and encompasses six dimensions: purpose in life (i.e., the extent to which respondents felt their lives had meaning, purpose, and direction); autonomy (i.e., whether they viewed themselves as living in accord with their own convictions); personal growth (i.e., the extent to which they were making use of their personal talents and potential); environmental mastery (i.e., how well they were managing their life situations); positive relationships (i.e., the depth of connection they had in ties with significant others); and self-acceptance (i.e., the knowledge and acceptance they had of themselves, including awareness of personal limitations) (Ryff, 1989)."
"Integrating Mental Health, Mental Illness, and Well-Being"
The contribution of positive mental health frameworks to the advancement of the field has been undeniable.
"However, definitions that overemphasize positive emotions and productive functioning as key indicators of mental health have been recently challenged because of the potential they have to discriminate against individuals and groups that, for example, might not be able to work productively or function within the environment because of individual physical characteristics or contextual constraints (Galderisi et al., 2015)."
"To address these issues, Keyes has successfully integrated the notions of mental illness, mental health, well-being, and other related terms in the literature into a conceptual framework that allows for a more comprehensive understanding of mental health (Keyes, 2005, 2007; Keyes and Michalec, 2010)."
"The model argues that neither pathogenic approaches focusing on the negative (e.g., mental illness) nor salutogenic approaches focusing on the positive (e.g., well-being) can alone accurately describe the mental health of a person (Keyes and Michalec, 2010)."
"Instead, the model proposes that mental illness and well-being represent two correlated but differentiated latent continua in defining mental health."
"More specifically, mental illness and well-being lie on two separate spectra, the first going from absent to present mental illness and the second"
"running from low to high well-being (Slade, 2010)."
"The absence of mental illness, therefore, does not necessarily imply high levels of well-being."
"Correspondingly, low levels of well-being do not always indicate the presence of mental illness."
"Further, in this model, mental health is defined as not only the absence of mental illness, not the mere presence of high well-being."
"Complete mental health (i.e., flourishing) is a result of experiencing low mental illness and high levels of well-being."
"Incomplete mental health (i.e., languishing), on the other hand, refers to the absence of mental illness symptoms and low reported levels of well- being."
Two other conditions are possible within this framework.
"Incomplete mental illness (i.e., struggling) refers to high levels of well-being accompanied by high mental illness symptoms."
"Lastly, complete mental illness (i.e., floundering) accounts for low levels of well-being and high mental illness symptoms (Keyes and Lopez, 2002)."
THE PRESENT STUDY
"In light of the complexity of the constructs of mental health and well-being and the multiple theoretical, disciplinary, and contextual approaches to their conceptualization, this study seeks to map out the terrain of international research and scholarship on mental health and university students for the period 1975– 2020."
"More specifically, this study aims to provide new insights into the development and current state of mental health research in university students by mapping and visually representing the literature on mental health and well-being of university students over the last 45 years in terms of the growth trajectory, productivity, and social, intellectual, and conceptual structure of the field."
"First, the study describes the development of research mental health and well-being in university students examining the trends in publication and citation data between 1975 and 2020 (i.e., growth trajectory)."
"Second, the study identifies the core journals and the research areas contributing most to the development of the field, as well as the key authors and countries leading the generation and dissemination of research on mental health and well-being in university populations (i.e., productivity)."
"Third, the study outlines the networks of scientific collaboration between authors, and countries (i.e., social structure)."
"Fourth, the scientific disciplines underlying the intellectual foundations of research on mental health and well-being in university settings (i.e., intellectual structure) are uncovered."
"Fifth, the study elucidates the topical foci (i.e., conceptual structure) of the research on the mental health and well-being of university students over the last 45 years."
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A bibliometric approach was used in this study to map the literature on mental health and well-being in university students over the last 45 years using metadata extracted from four indexes of the Web of Science (WoS): The Science Citation Index- Expanded (SCI-Expanded); the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI); the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI); and the Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI).
Several reasons justified the selection of the WoS database in this study.
"First, the WoS remains as the standard and most widely used for bibliometric analysis (Meho and Yang, 2007)."
"Second, the WoS is a multidisciplinary database and includes publications on mental health and well-being emerging from distinctive research areas and disciplines published in more than 20,000 journals (McVeigh, 2009)."
Using specialized databases such as PubMed would introduce biases into the search strategy favoring biomedical research disciplines.
"Still, it is important to note that interdisciplinary databases such as WoS and Scopus discriminate against publications in the Social Sciences and Humanities and publications in languages other than the English language (Mongeon and Paul-Hus, 2016), so the picture provided by WoS is still imperfect."
"Third, while other databases might provide wider coverage, WoS includes publication and citation information from 1900."
"For example, Scopus has complete citation information only from 1996 (Li et al., 2010)."
"Moreover, Google Scholar provides results of inconsistent accuracy in terms of citations, and citation analyses in PubMed are not available (Falagas et al., 2008)."
"Fourth, WoS has demonstrated better accuracy in its journal classification system compared to Scopus database (Wang and Waltman, 2016)."
The methodological approach used in this study is presented in Figure 1 and further elaborated in the following paragraphs.
Search Strategy
"To create a comprehensive corpus of documents on the mental health and well-being of university students, three parallel searches were performed, which accounted for the multiple approaches and perspectives that have been used in the field, as identified in the Section “Conceptualization of Mental Health, Mental Illness, and Well-Being: An Overview.” All the searches were conducted in the last week of January 2020."
The first search aimed at capturing research on mental health broadly and included one single keyword in the topic field: [“mental health”].
The second search was implemented to capture research focusing on pathogenic approaches to mental health.
"Key terms used in the literature to refer to the negative side of mental health, as well as the most frequent mental health problems experienced by university students, were introduced in this search in the title field: [“mental illness,” “mental disorder∗,” “mental distress,” “psychological distress,” “psychopathology,” “depression,” “anxiety,” “stress,” “suicide,” “eating disorder∗ ,” “substance use”]."
"In the third search, keywords reflecting salutogenic approaches to mental health were input."
"These included terms related to mental health from a positive mental health perspective (i.e., well-being)."
"These key terms were added in the title field and included the following: [“well-being,” “wellbeing,” “wellness,” “life satisfaction,” “happiness,” “positive affect,” “purpose in life,” “personal growth,” “self-determination”]."
"To retrieve research relevant only to higher education students, another set of keywords was imputed in all three searches in the title field."
"These included: [“university,” “college,” “higher education,” “tertiary education,” “post-secondary education,” “postsecondary education,” “undergrad∗ student,” “grad∗ student,” “master’s student,” “doctoral student,” “Ph.D."
student”].
The Boolean operator OR was used between keywords in all the three searches to secure a higher number of relevant hits.
"Also, asterisks were used as wildcards to account for multiple variations in several keywords (e.g., disorder and disorder-s)."
All searches were limited to journal articles published between 1975 and 2020 (both inclusive).
No restrictions on language were implemented in the search.
"The search strategy retrieved a total of 6,356 hits (nsearch1 = 2782; nsearch2 = 2814, nsearch3 = 760)."
"After the removal of duplicates, 5,561 research articles were finally selected and retained for the study."
"For each of the documents obtained in the search, the authors extracted metadata about the title of the paper, the year of publication, the journal, the number of citations, and the authors’ name, organization, and country."
"Also, the title, the abstract, the author’s keywords, and cited references were retrieved."
Data Analysis Procedures
The corpus of the literature was then analyzed using descriptive and bibliometric approaches to provide an overall picture of the evolution and current state of the research on mental health and wellbeing in university settings.
Frequency counts of the number of publications and citations per year were obtained to describe the growth trajectory of research on the mental health and well- being of university students.
"Rank ordered tables were produced to describe the productivity of the field in terms of core journals and research areas, as well as leading scholars and countries contributing to the development of the field."
"Bibliometric analyses in VOSViewer software were implemented to examine and visually represent the social, intellectual, and conceptual structure of the field."
VOSViewer is a freely available computer software for viewing and constructing bibliometric maps1.
"In VOSViewer, the units of analysis are journals, publications, citations, authors, or countries, depending on the focus of the analysis."
The units of analysis are represented in the maps as circular nodes.
"The size of the node accounts for volume (e.g., number of publications in the dataset by an author) and the position represents the similarity with other nodes in the map."
Closer nodes are more alike than nodes far apart from each other.
The lines connecting nodes represent the relationship between nodes and their thickness indicates the strength of that relationship.
"Finally, the color of the node denotes the cluster to which each node has been allocated."
"Nodes are clustered together based on relatedness (Van Eck et al., 2010)."
"The software uses a distance-based approach to constructing the bibliometric maps in three steps (Van Eck and Waltman, 2014)."
"In the first step, the software normalizes the differences between nodes."
"In the second step, the software builds a two-dimensional map where the distance between the nodes reflects the similarity between these nodes."
"In the third step, VOSViewer groups closely related nodes into clusters (Van Eck and Waltman, 2014)."
A series of co-authorship analyses were performed to examine the social structure of research on mental health and well- being in university students.
"In these analyses, the units of analysis were authors and countries/territories."
Each node in the map represents an author or a country/territory and the lines connecting them reflect the relationship between nodes.
"Clusters represent networks of scientific collaboration, which might be interpreted as groups of authors or countries frequently publishing together (e.g., research groups in the case of authors)."
Co-citation analysis of journals was implemented to explore the intellectual structure of the field.
"Here, the units of analysis were journals in the dataset and the map reflects co-citation relationships between journals."
Two journals are co-cited if there is a third journal citing these two.
"The more times a pair of journals are cited by other journals, the stronger their co-citation relationship will be."
Frequently co-cited journals are assumed to share theoretical and semantical grounds.
"Therefore, in our study, clusters of frequently co-cited journals can be interpreted as disciplines underlying the foundations of research on mental health and well-being in university students."
"Finally, a co-occurrence analysis of keywords was used to uncover the conceptual structure of the field."
"The units of analysis, in this case, were the authors’ keywords."
"The more often two keywords appear in the same record, the stronger their co-occurrence relationship."
"Clusters of co-occurring keywords represent in this study the topical foci (i.e., knowledge base)"
that have been addressed in the literature in mental health and well-being in university students in the last 45 years.
FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
Growth Trajectory: Evolution of Publications and Citations in the Field
The developmental patterns of a particular field can be well demonstrated by trends in publications and citations.
"The 5,561 publications in the dataset have been cited 87,096 times, with an average of 15.6 citations per item."
Figure 2 shows the growth trajectory of publication data of research on mental health and well-being in university students from 1975 to January 2020.
"Overall, the trends demonstrate a gradual increase in the scholarly interest in the mental health of university students over the last 45 years that can be organized in three stages: an emergence stage, in which publications rose slowly (1975–2000); a fermentation stage, with a notable increase in publications in the field (2000–2010); and a take-off stage, during which the number of records published per year in the field has almost risen 10 times (2010–2020)."
"The steady increase of publications in the last 15 years coincides with the first calls for attention on the increase and severity of mental problems and help-seeking behaviors of college students (Kadison and DiGeronimo, 2004; Evans et al., 2018), potentially indicating a growing interest in exploring the epidemiology of mental disorders and the role of universities in promoting the mental health and well-being of students."
"A similar pattern has also been observed in a recent bibliometric study examining global research on mental health both in absolute terms and as a proportion of all papers published in medicine and across disciplines, which certainly reflects an increase in the general interest in the field (Larivière et al., 2013)."
Productivity I: Core Journals and
Research Areas
"In total, 1,560 journals published the 5,561 records included in the dataset."
Table 1 presents the ten core journals in the field.
"The Journal of American College stands out as the main publication venue in the field, accumulating around 5% of the publications in the dataset (n = 270)."
"Psychological Reports and Journal of College Student Development also stand out, publishing 119 and 102 studies, respectively."
The Journal of Counseling Psychology ranks fourth in the list with 83 records.
"Despite being an interdisciplinary and relatively young journal, Plos One appears in the top five journal publishing research on mental health and well-being in university students."
The top research areas contributing to the publication of research on the mental health and well-being of university students are presented in Table 2.
Nearly half of the records in the dataset are published in psychology journals.
"Another influential research area in the field is psychiatry, which captures almost 20% of the publications."
Journals on education and educational research also accumulate a considerable number of publications in the field (15%).
"Other relevant research areas in the field are connected with health and medicine, including public environmental occupational health, substance abuse, general internal medicine, neurosciences neurology, health care sciences services, and nursing."
"Finally, the field is also grounded, although to a lower extent, in the publications emerging from journals in the social sciences, family studies, and social work research."
"All in all, the productivity analysis for journals and research areas showed that most research on mental health and well-being in university students is disseminated in journals in the “psy disciplines”’ (i.e., psychology and psychiatry) (McAvoy, 2014), which is consistent with previous research on mental health in general populations (e.g., Haslam and Lusher, 2011)."
"However, our findings demonstrated that the volume of research in psychology doubles that of research emerging from psychiatric journals."
"This contrasts with the findings by Haslam and Lusher (2011), who demonstrated that psychiatry journals had a greater influence on mental health research compared to clinical psychology journals and that psychiatry journals accumulate a higher volume of research and citations on mental health research."
"This is probably because our study includes publications emerging from all branches of psychology, unlike the study by Haslam and Lusher, which included only journals in the field of clinical psychology."
"Additionally, mental health services in higher education are typically provided by counseling centers led and staffed by non-medical professionals (e.g., psychologists, social workers, counselors, and family therapists) who tend to adopt developmental models of practice grounded in the behavioral sciences and focused on adjustment issues, vocational training, employment, and other personal needs rather than diagnosis and symptom reduction, more common in the biomedical sciences (i.e., psychiatry) (LeViness et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2019)."
Productivity II: Leading Authors and Countries/Territories
"The 5,561 publications in the dataset were published by a total of 16,161 authors from 119 countries worldwide."
Table 3 shows the researchers with the highest number of publications in the field.
"D. Eisenberg appears as the most productive researcher, followed by K. Peltzer and S. Pengpid."
Authors on the list come from diverse geographical backgrounds.
"Five of the authors work at three different American universities (University of Michigan, Harvard Medical School, and Boston University), two researchers work at KU Leuven University (Belgium), and two other authors are affiliated to the same two universities in Thailand and South Africa."
"Other prolific researchers are affiliated with higher education institutions in the Netherlands, Egypt, and Germany."
Countries and territories leading research on mental health and well-being of university students are presented in Table 4.
"The United States is the indisputable leader in this field, publishing more than half of the records in the dataset."
"This is nearly 10 times the number of publications produced in China, which occupies the second position in the ranking and accounts for nearly 6% of the volume of research in the dataset."
"Three predominantly English speaking countries/territories complete the top five of the ranking: Canada (265 records), Australia (254), and England (243)."
"The rest of the countries in the list are situated in Europe (Spain, Germany, Turkey), Western Asia (Iran), Africa (South Africa), and East Asia (Japan), which demonstrates that research on college students’ mental health and well-being is a matter of concern in different regions of the world, at least to some extent."
"Overall, the productivity analysis for authors and countries indicated that the research of mental health and well-being of university students occurs in a variety of locations around the world, especially in developed countries, and in a very prominent way, in the United States."
"This is not surprising since it is in those countries where better infrastructures and more abundant resources for research are available (Wong et al., 2006), and a more lasting tradition in the study of mental health, in general, exists (Gopalkrishnan, 2018)."
"However, Larivière et al."
(2013) found that the productivity of the United States on mental health research has dropped significantly and remained stable in other two English speaking countries (the United Kingdom and Canada) since 1980.
"On the contrary, the number of publications from European countries and the five major emerging national economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), has experienced remarkable growth, and collectively account nearly for half of the publications in the field."
"Still, the predominance of knowledge generated in the developed world today, which tends to be grounded on psychiatric and psychological perspectives, might be eclipsing non-traditional views on mental health and well-being that are popular in other regions of the world and, therefore, limiting the development of effective initiatives that align better with local norms, values, and needs in LMICs (Timimi, 2010; Summerfield, 2013)."
Social Structure: Networks of Scientific Collaboration
"Research collaboration is regarded as an indicator of quality research and a means to improve research productivity and academic impact (i.e., citations) (Kim, 2006; Abramo et al., 2009)."
"In particular, international research collaboration is considered a key contributor to the social construction of science and the evolution of scientific disciplines (Coccia and Wang, 2016)."
"There is recent evidence that national and international research collaborations have been accelerating in recent years (Gazni et al., 2012; Wagner et al., 2015), especially in applied fields such as medical and psychological disciplines (Coccia and Bozeman, 2016)."
"In this study, co-authorship analyses were performed to find out patterns in the scientific collaboration between researchers and countries/territories on the mental health and well-being of university students."
Figure 3 demonstrates collaborative ties among authors who published at least 5 articles in the dataset (n = 179).
The map shows the existence of multiple productive collaborative networks of five or more researchers contributing to the development of the field.
"The largest collaboration network (red cluster) represents an international research group composed of 15 scholars affiliated to universities in the United States, Belgium, and Netherlands."
"This cluster groups some of the leading scholars in the field, including R. P. Auerbach, R. Brauffaerts, R. C. Kressler, and P. Cuijpers."
"Moreover, researchers in this cluster lead The WHO World Mental Health International College Student (WMH-ICS) Initiative, a large scale international project aimed at promoting the mental health and well-being of college students around the world through generating epidemiological data of mental health issues in university students worldwide, designing web-based interventions for the prevention and promotion of mental health, and disseminating evidence-based interventions (Cuijpers et al., 2019)."
The second biggest cluster (green) represents an intra-national research network that includes 10 researchers from eight different higher education institutions in the United States.
"The dark blue cluster represents an institutional collaborative network, including nine researchers from the School of Public Health, Puerto Rico."
"Other prominent clusters in the map represent collaborative research networks between eight (olive color) and seven researchers (turquoise, violet, orange, and mellow mauve)."
"This contrasts, however, with the limited collaboration that exists between clusters."
"Only four of the clusters on the map demonstrate some kind of scientific collaboration in the field (light blue, pink, brown, and yellow)."
Cross-country collaboration networks in mental health and well-being of university students study are presented in Figure 4.
Research collaborations between countries with 20 or more publications were considered in this analysis (n = 45).
The
"United States occupies the central position of the map and shares collaborative ties with all other countries/territories, forming a cluster together with China, South Korea, and Taiwan."
"Overall, the results suggest that international collaborations in the field are framed to a large extent by cultural, linguistic, and geographical proximity."
"For instance, the largest cluster (red) is formed by two European countries (Spain and Portugal) and other South American countries with whom they share historical and cultural backgrounds."
Other European countries form the purple cluster.
"Similarly, the blue cluster clearly brings together predominantly English-speaking countries and territories, while the green cluster agglomerates a range of Asian countries."
"Collectively, the results of our study suggest that research collaboration in the field of mental health and well-being in university students remains relatively scarce and localized to date."
"The social structure of the field at the author level could be described as an archipelago formed by a large number of islands (research groups) of different composition and size but with few bridges connecting them, which suggests a relatively fragmented research community."
"Moreover, while the existence of international collaborative networks was evident in the analysis, they seem to be formed within national borders, between researchers in neighboring countries/territories, or between countries that share cultural, linguistic, and historical heritages."
"This may be due to the important role that cultural and traditional values play in the conceptualization of mental health and well-being across contexts (Eshun and Gurung, 2009; Vaillant, 2012; Fernando, 2019)."
"Also, language differences, divergent cross-national institutional and organizational traditions, and increased costs of extramural collaboration, have been found to complicate the formation and continuity of research partnerships in health research (Hooper et al., 2005; Freshwater et al., 2006)."
"Nevertheless, limited within- and between-country research collaboration arguably poses challenges to the development of a field in terms of lost opportunities to challenge assumptions taken for granted and move toward fresh perspectives, push boundaries in methods and techniques, meet diverse groups of people from differing cultures and get immersed in those cultures, share information, resources, and skills, and address common mental health problems through the pooling of resources (Rolfe et al., 2004; Freshwater et al., 2006)."
"Intellectual Structure: Disciplines Underlying the Foundations of the Field Interdisciplinarity is considered as a valuable approach to address the complex and multidimensional nature of health and well- being (Mabry et al., 2008)."
"Buckton (2015) argues that the integration of medical, psychological, and social sciences have contributed to generate “new insights into theory, practice, and research in mental health and development.” (3)."
"To examine the disciplines underlying research on the mental health and well-being of university students, a journal co-citation analysis"
was performed.
"In this analysis, only journals with at least 50 citations were considered (n = 593)."
The nodes on the map represent journals and their size reflects the number of co-citation relationships with other journals.
"Colors account for journal clusters, which agglutinate journals with higher co-citation relationships and stronger semantic connectedness."
Clusters were interpreted and labeled accounting for the WoS categorization of the journals with the highest co-citation links within each cluster.
"For example, if the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the Journal of Counseling Psychology, and Personality and Individual Differences clustered together, this group was interpreted as the personality, social, and counseling psychology cluster."
"In general, the findings of this study suggest that research on mental health and well-being in university students is interdisciplinary, to a certain extent, and mainly emerges from the convergence of research conducted in the behavioral and biomedical sciences, as it has been suggested elsewhere (Schumann et al., 2014; Wittchen et al., 2014b)."
"More specifically, the map shows that the research in the mental health and well-being of university students is constructed through the integration of knowledge generated in five interconnected disciplines (see Figure 5)."
"To the left of the map, the red cluster integrates journals on personal, social, and counseling psychology."
"To the right, the blue cluster represents the contribution of psychiatric journals to research to the formation and development of the field."
"At the top, the yellow cluster groups journals on substance abuse and issues related to alcohol consumption, addiction, and interpersonal violence."
"At the bottom of the map, journals covering topics on eating behaviors, sleep, and other issues related to physical health converge on the green cluster."
"At the center of the map is the purple cluster, which includes journals in the area of clinical psychology and behavioral therapy."
"More broadly, the findings suggest that biomedical sciences contribute to a large extent to the composition of the field."
"Psychiatric research emerged in our study as an obvious building block in the study of university students’ mental health and well-being, which is not surprising considering the historical contributions of biomedical disciplines to mental health research (Schwartz and Corcoran, 2010)."
"Within the behavioral sciences, personality and social psychology, which explores processes and mechanisms through which social phenomena influence mental health and well-being (Sánchez Moreno and Barrón López de Roda, 2003), appears as a key discipline underlying the foundations of the field."
"Surprisingly, clinical psychology journals occupy a central position in the map and demonstrate co-citation relationships with journals from all other clusters but make up the most dispersed network and account for a considerably lower volume of co-citation relationships in the field."
"This suggests that clinical psychology journals are more subordinate to journals in other disciplines in terms of citations flows, and ultimately, play"
"a less unique role in research on the mental health and well-being of university students, as suggested by Haslam and Lusher (2011)."
"Interestingly, research arising from the social sciences (e.g., sociology and anthropology) does not seem to make a distinctive contribution to the intellectual structure of the field, which suggests that the influence of social contexts and cultures on university students’ mental health and well-being (e.g., inequality, social norms, public policies, cultural beliefs, and values) is an underexplored research area."
"Still, the density of co-citation network relationships within and between clusters is particularly noteworthy, considering the lack of common language between disciplines, the absence of a shared philosophy of practice on mental health, and the tensions between medical, psychological, and social explanations of mental distress (Bailey, 2012)."
Conceptual Structure: Topical Foci Addressed in the Literature Over the Last 45 Years
The topical foci of research on the mental health and well-being of university students during the 1975–January 2020 period are presented in Figure 6.
The map offers a visual representation of the co-occurrence analysis of author keywords of all the publications included in the dataset.
Only the most frequently occurring keywords (25+ occurrences) were considered in the analysis (n = 84).
Items that were not related to others and do not belong to the existing clusters were excluded.
The size of the nodes indicates the occurrence of author keywords in the dataset and the thickness of edges represents the co-occurrence strength between pairs of keywords.
"The most frequent keywords in the dataset, excluding students’ descriptors (e.g., college students and university students), refer to common mental health challenges experienced by university students such as depression (n = 612), anxiety (n = 353), and stress (n = 341)."
"Salutogenic-related keywords such as well-being and life satisfaction occurred less often (n = 138, n = 113, respectively), suggesting that pathogenic approaches to the exploration of mental health issues in higher education are more widespread."
"More broadly, seven general themes seem to summarize the topical foci of interest in the field of mental health and well-being of university students over the last 45 years."
"First, there has been a general interest in positive mental health, as denoted by frequently co-occurring key terms such as well- being, self-esteem, life satisfaction, social support, emotional intelligence, and happiness (red cluster)."
"Second, mental disorders stand as another theme widely addressed in the literature, with a special emphasis on depression, anxiety, and to a lesser extent, suicide and suicidal ideation (green cluster)."
"A third topical area in this field has been substance abuse, most predominantly alcohol consumption (blue cluster)."
"The fourth theme reflects college counseling for mental health, including interventions and protective factors such as mindfulness, stress management, spirituality, and help-seeking (yellow cluster)."
"Other topics reflected in the map are mental illness stigma (purple), stress (e.g., psychological distress and coping) (light blue), and mental health measurement (orange)."
CONCLUSION
This study provides a comprehensive overview of the research on university students’ mental health and well-being in the last 45 years using bibliometric indicators.
"In general, the results reveal interesting trends in the evolution of the field over the last four decades and promising scientific patterns toward a better understanding of the mental health and well-being of university students internationally."
"First, the interest in the mental health and well-being of university students has grown in the last decades and in a very significant way during the last 10 years, indicating that this area has not still reached its maturity period and will continue developing in the future."
"Second, research in the field is relatively interdisciplinary and emerges from the convergence of research conducted in several disciplines within the behavioral and biomedical sciences."
"Third, research in this field is produced by a community of productive researchers coming from several regions around the world, most notably in the United States, which secures a generation of scholars that will continue shaping the field in the years to come."
"Fourth, over the last 45 years, researchers have been able to address a multitude"
"of research topics in the field, including positive mental health, mental disorders, substance abuse, counseling, stigma, stress, and mental health measurement."
"However, this study also identified some issues that could be hindering the development of the study of the mental health and well-being of university students."
"For example, the research available overrepresents theoretical and disciplinary approaches from the developed world."
Additional studies on the field from developing economies and LMICs are needed to provide a more comprehensive picture and ensure a fair representation of the multiple perspectives available in the field.
Such studies would inform administrators and practitioners on how to broaden and enrich available programs and initiatives to promote mental health and well-being in higher education contexts in order to offer alternative forms of support that university students find appropriate for their social and cultural values.
"Moreover, the research community contributing to the development of the field is relatively fragmented."
"There are multiple research groups but little research collaborations between them and, at the international level, these connections tend to be limited by geographic, cultural, and language proximity."
"In this context, more actions like the WMH-ICS Initiative could provide a partial solution to this problem by strengthening national and international research partnerships and facilitating knowledge exchange across regions."
"Also, special issues in the core journals in the field inviting cross-cultural studies on the topic could contribute to promoting research collaboration across regions and research in less represented countries."
"The field would also benefit from a greater volume of research from the social sciences and humanities exploring the influence of social, cultural, economic, and educational factors on the conceptualization, manifestation, and experience of mental health and well-being."
"Moreover, more studies emerging from disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, business, and education, would likely increase the permeability of positive mental health concepts into the field and contribute to the promotion of salutogenic approaches to the study of mental health and well-being of university students."
This study has several limitations.
"First, publications were retrieved only from the WoS database, which limits the generalizability of the findings."
"Second, WoS provides stronger coverage of Life Sciences, Biomedical Sciences, and Engineering, and includes a disproportionate number of publications in the English language (Mongeon and Paul-Hus, 2016)."
"This could partially explain the low number of publications emerging from the Social Sciences, the Arts, and the Humanities, and research conducted in non-English speaking countries in the present study."
"Third, only journal articles were retrieved for analysis, excluding other relevant publications in the field such as reviews, book chapters, and conference proceedings."
"Future studies could replicate the findings of this study using alternative databases (e.g., Scopus and PubMed) or a combination of them, as well as different filters in the search strategy, to provide an alternative coverage of research conducted in the field."
"Nevertheless, we believe that the bibliometric approach used in this study offers novel insights about the development and current status of the field and some of the challenges that undermine its progression."
Promoting Mental Health and Psychological Thriving in University Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Three Well-Being Interventions
This study aimed to address the decline in mental health on U.S. university campuses by examining the effects of three interventions.
"University students suffer from high levels of anxiety, depression, and suicide."
Counseling centers on university campuses are struggling to meet increased demand.
"The cost to students and universities could be buffered by offering preventative, psychoeducational, and skill-building training programs that promote mental health and psychological thriving."
"To date, the research literature has not yielded systematically evaluated and recommendable preventative mental health and well-being programs for university students."
"In a registered, randomized controlled trial, 131 university students were either placed in a non-intervention control group (N = 47) or received training in one of three 30-hour, eight-week semester-long well-being programs: SKY Campus Happiness (“SKY”; N = 29), Foundations of Emotional Intelligence (“EI”; N = 21) or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (“MBSR”; N = 34)."
"Compared to the control group and controlling for variance of baseline measurements and multiple comparisons, SKY Campus Happiness showed the greatest impact, benefiting six outcomes: depression, stress, mental health, mindfulness, positive affect and social connectedness."
EI benefited one outcome: mindfulness.
The MBSR group showed no change.
Delivering SKY or EI to university students may be a cost-effective and efficient way to proactively and preventatively address mental health for university students and reduce the financial strain on universities.
INTRODUCTION
"The World Health Organization defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (1)."
"Similarly, we can think of mental health as not merely the absence of mental illness (e.g., anxiety and depression), but also the presence of psychological thriving (e.g., gratitude, social connectedness, mindfulness)."
Mental health in college and university students in the United States has declined over the last decade (2).
College-aged adults (18–25 years of age) are at greatest risk for mental illness (3) and have the highest prevalence of any type of mental illness [25.8%; (4)].
"The most common self-reported concerns by university students visiting counseling centers in the United States between 2017 and 2018 were anxiety (58.9%), depression (48.0%) and stress (46.9%) (5, 6)."
"A 2018 American College Health Association survey of 88,178 college students across 140 campuses reported that 60% of students self-reported experiencing overwhelming anxiety and 40% self-reported feeling so depressed they had difficulty functioning (7)."
"Mental illness interferes with student learning and is significantly associated with lower GPA (7, 8)."
"Mental illness is also associated with substance abuse in university students in the United States (9), which further negatively impacts academic performance (10) and exacerbates mental illness."
"Mental illness and substance abuse are associated with more than 90% of all cases of suicide in the United States (11, 12)."
"While suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States (13), it is the second leading cause of death for college-aged students, after traffic accidents (14)."
Recent years have seen a record increase in suicides by young adults aged 15–24 years old (13).
"The highest number of suicides ever reported for this age group was in 2017 (2, 13, 15)."
"From 2000 to 2016, over 10% of students reported having seriously considered suicide in the past year (2, 5–7, 11, 13, 16)."
"Whereas social connection, a measure of psychological thriving, is predictive of emotional health, mental illness is often associated with loneliness and isolation which in turn can further deteriorate mental health and increase suicidal ideation (17–24)."
Campus counseling centers are inadequately prepared to meet increased demand for services.
"From 2009 to 2014, campus counseling centers experienced an average increase of 30% of students seeking treatment for an average 6% institutional enrollment increase (25)."
"Ninety-four percent of counseling center directors report an increasing number of students with severe diagnosed mental health problems presenting on their campuses (26), and 57% of directors indicate that their resources are insufficient to meet students’ needs (5)."
The traditional approach to addressing mental illness is to address symptoms after they have presented themselves.
"Students are typically diagnosed and then prescribed medication, counseling or a combination thereof (27, 28)."
"A steady increase in demand for counseling, however, makes this recourse financially unsustainable (29)."
"Moreover, medications often present with aversive side effects (4) that can disrupt"
"cognitive functions [e.g., attention and memory, essential for succeeding in college (30)]."
"Finally, these types of interventions are not only applied post-hoc but also focus exclusively on treating mental illness symptoms without setting up the conditions for psychological resilience and thriving."
A preventative and proactive approach to mental health that provides students with empirically validated tools for psychological resilience and thriving prior to developing symptoms may be a viable additional support to the efforts made by campus counseling centers.
Several studies indicate that skill-building interventions are effective in improving the lives of adolescents and college students (31–33).
A recent meta-analysis of universal mental health prevention programs on university campuses showed that the most successful programs included skill-building with supervised practice (34).
"These programs, as compared with skill-building programs without supervised practice or those with only psychoeducational curricula, were significantly more successful in reducing anxiety, stress, depression, and distress and improving social and emotional skills (34)."
"However, most mental health prevention programs offered by campuses tend to fail due to a primary focus on psychoeducation (34)."
"Without the components of skill-building (including practice time, reflection, questions and discussion) and supervised practice, integration of the material is challenging (34)."
"Overall, the research literature has not yielded systematically evaluated and recommendable skill-building protocols for psychological resilience that university administrators can implement (35)."
Our study aimed to address this gap in the literature: we examined the impacts of three different skill-building prevention interventions with supervised practice that past research suggests could improve student mental health.
"We selected SKY Campus Happiness (SKY) because it has been shown to increase psychological resilience (36, 37), decrease stress (38) and reduce impulsive behavior (39) in students."
"In general populations, SKY has also been shown to improve emotion regulation (40), decrease stress (41–43), anxiety and depression (44–50), and reduce PTSD (51, 52)."
"The second program we selected was Foundations in Emotional Intelligence (EI), a program that was adapted from both a university course and a pre-existing evidence-based approach to social and emotional learning, RULER (53)."
RULER has shown promising results for school-aged children in quasi-experimental and randomized controlled studies.
"In particular, RULER, has been shown to increase social and emotional competence (54), improve academic grades (54), emotion skills (54), cooperation (55), social problem-solving skills (56), and student-teacher relationships (57)."
The third program we selected was Koru Mindfulness.
"Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to reduce psychological distress (58, 59), stress (60), and anxiety (61) in university students."
"In general populations it has also been shown to reduce depression (62), anxiety (62), and stress symptoms (63), and to increase self-compassion (64), self- esteem (65), sleep quality (65), and physical health (66)."
"Since mental health may be considered on a spectrum from mental illness to psychological thriving, we aimed to measure the impact of the interventions with measures spanning that spectrum (from anxiety and depression to gratitude and social connectedness)."
We hypothesized that the manner in which each workshop would impact mental health would differ depending on the focus of the intervention curricula.
"Based on past research, we hypothesized that all three groups would benefit measures of mental health such as anxiety, stress and depression."
We also hypothesized that the interventions would improve measures of psychological thriving.
"Given past research, we further hypothesized that SKY would also improve psychological resilience measures."
"We hypothesized that EI, given its emphasis on emotion regulation, would also improve positive affect."
"With its focus on mindfulness and self-compassion, we hypothesized that Koru Mindfulness would also benefit mindfulness and self-compassion."
"An initial pilot study compared three well-being/skill- building interventions—SKY Campus Happiness (SKY), Foundations of Emotional Intelligence (EI), and Koru Mindfulness—to an inactive control group."
The majority of the 203 pilot undergraduate participants recommended the well- being interventions.
"However, largely no effects were observed in self-reported well-being."
The lack of intervention effects despite high likability was potentially due to low exposure and practice of the techniques and strategies taught during intervention delivery (10 h over 5 weeks) and lack of at-home practice (mode days of reported at-home practice was zero).
"Building on the pilot, our pre-registered main study (Clinicaltrials.gov, Registration number: NCT03229577) had the same randomized controlled design with more intervention exposure (30 h over 8 weeks) in addition to at-home practice requirements."
SKY and EI expanded the curriculum to include 8 weeks of content.
We used the Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction program instead of Koru Mindfulness since its curriculum is designed for an 8-week period.
The same self- reported well-being measures were used here as in the pilot.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recruitment
"Undergraduate students from a large, four-year private university learned about the study through departmental email lists."
Applicants who had participated in programs similar to the study interventions or had significant mindfulness expertise were excluded.
One hundred ninety-three students committed to joining the semester-long study.
"A total of 1,305 students declared an initial interest in the study."
See Figure 1 for the process by which the final participant sample was formed.
Participants were excluded from this study if they had previously partaken in any of the study’s interventions or similar programs.
Students considered “experts” in mindfulness (who practiced any type of mindful practice five or more times a week) were also excluded.
"Likewise, students who participated in the previous year’s pilot study were excluded from participation."
"Based on these criteria, 515 students were excluded from the study."
"The remaining sample of 790 prospective students were randomly distributed into the study’s four groups: SKY, MBSR, EI, and control."
"After randomization, each student interested in participating in the study was provided with the schedule and requirements."
"Prospective participants at this time were invited to enroll, committing to pre- and post-testing, attendance and dedication requirements."
"Of the 790 prospective participants, 193 students accepted the invitation to join the study."
"During the course of the study, fifty-eight students dropped out due to schedule conflicts (N = 11), inability to meet the time commitment (N = 9), dismissal for excessive absences (N = 4), discontinued correspondence with the researchers (N =11), physical health reasons (N = 1), mental health reasons (N = 1) or unknown reasons (N = 21)."
One hundred and thirty-five students completed the study.
Another three participants were removed for having extreme outlier data on ten or more outcome variables.
A fourth participant was removed for reporting lying on all of their practice logs.
The final sample included 131 participants with an average age of 19.67 years (SD = 1.02).
"56.5% of participants were White, 30.5% Asian, 16.0% Hispanic or Latino, 13.0% Black or African American, 6.1% two or more races, 3.8% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1.5% other, and 0.8% declined to provide information."
"Thirty-five and one-half percent of participants were male, 59.5% female, 3.1% genderqueer/gender non- conforming, and 0.8% reported “different identity”."
"There were no significant differences between groups in gender, mental health diagnoses, current psychological treatment, or personality [measured by the Big Five Inventory, (67)]."
Descriptive statistics for all measures at T1 and T2 can be found in Table A (overall descriptives) and Table B (group- specific descriptives) in Supplementary Materials.
Procedure
"Exactly one week prior to the interventions, all participants completed Time 1 (T1) questionnaires in person after providing written informed consent for the protocol approved by the Yale University Institutional Review Board."
"Exactly three days after the last intervention session, all participants completed the Time 2 (T2) questionnaires in person."
Students practiced techniques learned in class at least three times per week and filled out practice logs.
Active group participants were compensated $300.
Control group participants were compensated $80.
"The three interventions (SKY, EI and MBSR) offered equal dosage of instruction: classes were taught twice per week for a total of 30 h over eight weeks during the course of a university semester (with a two-week break in the middle for spring break)."
The 30 h of intervention included one or more short retreats in addition to class time.
Attendance was mandatory (2 absences were allowed).
Interventions were delivered by certified facilitators with seven or more years of teaching experience.
"Facilitators were blind to research hypotheses, data collection, and analyses."
"SKY is a university leadership and well-being program (campushappiness.org) that includes stress-management and tools for psychological resilience: yoga postures, breathing exercises, a breath-based meditation technique [Sudarshan Kriya Yoga; (68)]."
"SKY also includes positive psychology skills (e.g., gratitude, social connection, acts of kindness, meaning and purpose)."
"In addition, the curriculum includes discussion and application of leadership skills and service learning."
Foundations of Emotional Intelligence (EI)
EI is an emotional intelligence program focused on teaching knowledge of emotions and emotion regulation (54).
"EI was adapted from a university course on emotional intelligence and an evidence-based approach to social and emotional learning for school-aged children, RULER (www.rulerapproach.org)."
"RULER is an acronym that stands for the five skills of emotional intelligence: recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing and regulating emotions."
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)
MBSR is a mindfulness meditation program [https://www.
"umassmed.edu/cfm/mindfulness-based-programs/, (69)] designed for “progressive acquisition of mindful awareness, of mindfulness” (66)."
"It involves instruction in three formal techniques: mindfulness meditation, body scanning (systematic awareness of different parts of the body from toes to the head) and simple yoga postures."
"In addition, the class includes discussions about meditation and its practical application to daily life."
Measures
"Outcome variables were divided along three categories: mental health, psychological thriving and health outcomes (physical health and sleep)."
We used a wide range of self-reported outcome measures to ensure reliable capture of change.
Self- report measures assessed the effects of the programs at T1 and T2 along these categories.
Participants completed two additional measures not included here: an emotion perception task and the Human Well-Being Scale.
Both are in the development phase and unvalidated.
"In addition, participants completed a measure of creativity not related to well-being, not included here."
Mental Health
Burnout
"The Single-Item Measure of Burnout (70, 71) contains the item: “Overall, based on your definition of burnout, how would you rate your level of burnout?”."
Participants choose one answer ranging from 1 = I enjoy my work.
I have no symptoms of burnout to 5 = I feel completely burned out and often wonder if I can go on.
I am at the point where I may need some changes or may need to seek some sort of help.
Stress
The Perceived Stress Scale 10-Item Inventory [PSS-10; (72); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.85] asks how frequently participants felt stress or had difficulties coping with life stresses on a scale ranging from 1 = never to 4 = very often.
"Example items include, “In the last month, how often have you felt that you were unable to control the important things in your life?” and “In the last month, how often have you felt that things were going your way?”."
"Distress, Anxiety and Depression."
"The Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire [MASQ-D30; (73)] consists of three subscales that measure: general distress symptoms (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.87), anhedonic depressive symptoms (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.80), and anxious arousal symptoms (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.90)."
Items were rated on a scale of 1 = very slightly or not at all to 5 = extremely.
"Examples of items include, “In the last two weeks I felt irritable” or “felt optimistic.”"
Mental Health
"Participants answered the question: “In general, would you say your health is...?” Items were rated on a scale 1 = poor to 5 = excellent."
"This self-assessment item was modeled from the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) National Health Survey (12), and The RAND Corporation’s 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36; (74)]."
Psychological Thriving
Psychological Well-Being
The Ryff Scale of Psychological Well-being is an 18-item scale [RYFF; (75)].
"Items are phrased as statements about the self, to which participants rate their agreement on a scale of 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree."
"Examples of items include, “I like most parts of my personality” and “The demands of everyday life often get me down.” This scale includes six subscales, each measured using three items."
": Autonomy (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.70), Environmental Mastery (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.61), Personal Growth (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.48), Positive Relations (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.67), Purpose in Life (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.35), Self-acceptance (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.72)."
Life Satisfaction
The Satisfaction with Life Scale [SWLS; (76); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.82] is a five-item scale.
Items are rated on a scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree.
"Examples of items include, “The conditions of my life are excellent” and “If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing.”"
Positive Affect
The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS; (77); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.89] is a 20-item scale containing two subscales each containing ten items: pleasant emotions and unpleasant emotions.
Participants rate the extent to which they feel specific emotions over the past week on a scale from 1 = very slightly or not at all to 5 = extremely.
"Examples of emotions include “Excited”, “Nervous”, “Ashamed”, and “Determined”."
Negative Affect
"The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, see Positive Affect, above (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.87)."
Gratitude
The Gratitude Questionnaire-Six Item Form [GQ-6; (78); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.86] is a 6-item measure.
Items are rated on a scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree.
"Examples of items include, “I have so much in my life to be thankful for” and “Long amounts of time can go by before I feel grateful to something or someone.”"
Self-Compassion
"The Self-Compassion-Short Form [SCS-SF; (79); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.89] is a 12-item scale measuring the three components of self-compassion: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness."
Participants rate how often they act in the presented manner using a five-point scale from 1 = almost never to 5 = almost always.
Examples of items include “I try to be understanding and patient toward aspects of my personality I don’t like” and “I’m disapproving and judgmental about my own flaws and inadequacies.”
Mindfulness
Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ-15; (80); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.81] is a fifteen-item scale that participants rate on a scale from 1 = never or very rarely true to 5 = very often or always true depending on how their level of agreement with the statements.
"Examples of items include, “I’m good at finding words to describe my feelings” and “I do jobs or tasks automatically without being aware of what I’m doing.”"
Adaptive Coping
The Brief COPE scale has 28 items that assess tendencies for using adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies [(81); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.81] Items are rated on a scale from 1 = I haven’t been doing this at all to 4 = I’ve been doing this a lot.
"Examples of items include, “I’ve been giving up trying to deal with it” and “I’ve been trying to come up with a strategy about what I should do.”"
Maladaptive Coping
"See Adaptive Coping, above (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.75)."
Optimism
The Life Orientation Test- Revised [LOT-R; (82); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.852] measures optimism.
This test includes 10 items rated on a 5-point scale from 1 = I disagree a lot to 5 = I agree a lot.
"Examples of items include, “ If something can go wrong for me, it will” and “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.”"
Self-Esteem
The Single Item Self-Esteem Scale [SISE; (83)] is a single item measure of the construct of self-esteem that has been validated against the well-known Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.
Scores range from 1 - 5 with low self-esteem indicated by a score of 1.
Social Connectedness
The Social Connectedness Scale Revised [SCS-R; (84); Cronbach’s Alpha=0.94] was used to measure social connectedness.
Items were rated on a scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree.
"Sample items include, “I am able to connect with other people”, “I see myself as a loner”, and “I feel like an outsider.”"
Physical Health and Sleep
"Participants answered two questions: “In general, would you say your health is...?” Items were rated on a scale 1 = poor to 5 = excellent."
"And “Over the last 2 weeks, how many days have you had trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?” Items were rated on a scale from 1 (day) to 14 (days)."
These assessments were also modeled on the CDC and RAND questionnaires mentioned under “Mental Health.”
Acceptability Assessments
"At T2 (post-test), students answered 2 questions to which they could answer “yes,” “no,” or “maybe”: 1) Would you recommend that your university provide students with this workshop?, 2) Would you recommend this workshop to a friend?"
Analyses
The correlations between variables can be found in Table 1.
Cronbach’s alphas for each of the measures at each of time points can be found in Table A in Supplementary Materials.
Treatment effects were tested with autoregressive models.
"Dummy variables were used to compare each of the three treatment groups to the control group, which was used as the reference group in the dummy variables (see Figure 2)."
"The outcomes at T1 (pre-test) and T2 (post-test) were regressed on the dummy variables representing the effects of the three treatment groups, compared to the control group."
The outcome at T2 was regressed on the outcome at T1 to control for T1 levels.
"All regressions were conducted in Mplus [Version 8.1; (85)], using a robust estimator (Maximum Likelihood Robust, MLR) due to non-normal distributions and outliers and Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation for missing data."
"This regression-based approach was selected over repeated measures MANOVAs to address the non-normality of the outcome variables, particularly outliers, and the problem of missing data from dropouts."
"Since we had directed hypotheses for the comparisons of each intervention group to the control group, we report one-tailed p- values."
"Due to the multiple comparisons, the p-values were Bonferroni-corrected for 72 hypotheses; 24 outcomes multiplied with 3 intervention dummy variables."
"The adjusted p-value needed to be <= 0.000641026 (or 0.001, since Mplus only reports three decimal points)."
RESULTS
Treatment Effects at T2
"To estimate treatment effects, we conducted autoregressive regression models."
"In these models, treatment groups were represented by dummy variables, comparing each treatment group to the reference control group."
"The outcomes at T1 and T2 were regressed on the three treatment group dummy variables, and the outcome at T1 was regressed on the T1-level of itself, to control for baseline levels."
"Due to the relatively small sample size, we conducted a separate regression for each outcome."
Figure 1 shows examples of the regression models conducted (for treatment effects at T2).
"The detailed results for all regressions that examined treatment effects, including p- values, are reported in Tables 2–4."
All effects below are in comparison to the control group and controlling for T1:
Effects of SKY
"The SKY group scored significantly higher than the control group on three mental health outcomes at T2, while controlling for the T1 levels in these three outcomes: depression (MASQ; b = −0.29), mental health (b = 0.25), and stress (PSS-10; b = −0.32)."
"Moreover, the SKY group scored significantly higher than the control group on three outcomes of psychological thriving: mindfulness (FFMQ-15; b = 0.26), positive affect (PANAS; b = 0.30), and social connectedness (SCS-R; b = 0.21)."
Effects of EI
The EI group scored significantly higher than the control group on one aspect of psychological thriving: mindfulness (FFMQ-15; b = 0.28).
Effects of MBSR
The MBSR group did not differ in any outcome from the control group at T2.
"(However, see below for findings warranting replications with larger samples)."
Uncorrected Treatment Effects at T2
"The strict Bonferroni correction, used to correct for the multiple comparisons, led us to decrease the acceptable p-value from the conventional 0.050 to 0.000."
"However, given our small sample size, the likelihood of detecting effects with such a strict threshold for significance is small."
There were several findings of effects that were significant at the p ≤ 0.05 level that became insignificant after the alpha adjustment.
We suggest that these effects be examined in future studies with larger samples as these effects do warrant further investigation.
These were the differences between intervention groups and the control group at T2 that were significant at the p ≤ 0.05-level but not at the adjusted p ≤ 0.000-level were:
Effects of SKY
"Twelve outcomes warranting replication with larger samples: environment-related well-being (Ryff; b = 0.27); self- acceptance (Ryff; b =0.25); burnout (b = −0.23), self- compassion (SCS-SF; b = 0.20), adaptive coping (COPE; b = 0.20), negative affect (PANAS; b = −0.19), self-esteem (b = 0.18), maladaptive coping (COPE; b = −0.18), distress (MASQ; b = −0.16), sleep problems (b = −0.16), life satisfaction (SWLS; b = 0.15), relationship-related well- being (Ryff; b = 0.15); autonomy (Ryff; b = 0.14), gratitude (GQ-6; b = 0.14), anxiety (MASQ; b = −0.12)."
Effects of EI
"Nine outcomes warranting replication with larger samples: maladaptive coping (COPE; b = −0.19), self-acceptance (RYFF; b =0.18), growth-related well-being (RYFF; b =0.18), adaptive coping (COPE; b = 0.17), negative affect (PANAS; b = −0.17), mental health (b = 0.16), life satisfaction (SWLS; b = 0.15), social connectedness (SCS-R; b = 0.13), anxiety (MASQ; b = −0.13), and gratitude (GQ-6; b = 0.13)."
Effects of MBSR
"Five outcomes warranting replication with larger samples: positive affect (PANAS; b = 0.26), burnout (b = −0.20), autonomy (Ryff; b =0.15), mindfulness (FFMQ-15; b = 0.18), and adaptive coping (COPE; b = 0.17)."
We also compared the intervention groups with each other on all the outcomes for which multiple interventions showed significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) to the control group (see Tables F-N in Supplementary Materials).
There was no significant difference between the intervention groups on any of these outcomes after multiple comparison correction using the strict Bonferroni correction.
Robustness Check
We used nonparametric Mann-Whitney-U-tests for pairwise comparisons between each treatment group and the control group in the change score T2 minus T1 on the outcome variables.
The Mann-Whitney-U test indicated largely the same results as the aforementioned regressions.
Please see the Tables in the Supplementary Materials detailing results of the Mann-Whitney-U tests for the comparisons of the change scores from T1 to T2 (Table C).
"Since the regression analyses did not directly assess change from T1 to T2, we additionally examined whether the change was significant by comparing T1 and T2 for each outcome variable with paired-samples t-test (Table D, Supplementary Materials)."
Attrition analyses can also be found in the Supplementary Material (Table E).
Acceptance of the Intervention
"Similarly to the pilot study, the majority of students in all three groups said they would recommend the interventions to their university and friends, suggesting good acceptance of the programs among the students."
"See Figure 1, Supplementary Materials."
DISCUSSION
"In sum, compared to the control group and controlling for baseline levels in the outcomes and for multiple comparisons, the SKY group benefited six outcomes (depression, stress, mental health, positive affect, mindfulness, and social connectedness), the EI group benefited one outcome (mindfulness), and the MBSR benefited none."
"SKY’s wide range of results may be explained by its multi- component and comprehensive curriculum including a number of different factors that prior research suggests can improve mental health and psychological thriving: positive psychology (86), yoga/breathing/meditation (87–89), and community service (90)."
"Modulation of respiration, in particular, has been linked to improvements in neuro-cognitive function (91, 92)."
"Since cognitive deficits are often observed in mental health conditions (93), breathing exercises may impact mental health"
"and psychological thriving via improved cognitive function, such as enhanced attention (94)."
"Breathing techniques have also been found to enhance autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility related to emotional control and psychological well- being in healthy participants (95)."
"The EI program impacted mindfulness, perhaps because of the program’s focus on self-awareness and emotional awareness in particular (54)."
"MBSR’s lack of significant findings were surprising given a substantial body of research suggesting its potential benefits for a wide range of populations [e.g., (62, 80)]."
"Meta-analyses on MBSR, however, are mixed and suggest a range of effect sizes from small to large depending on the measured construct [e.g., (96)]."
MBSR’s comparatively modest impact in the current study’s population may be explained by the fact that MBSR is designed for a general community audience whereas SKY and EI programs are specifically tailored for university students.
Further studies are required to determine the impact of potential adaptations of the MBSR curriculum for university students.
"While the MBSR intervention showed no significant difference from the control group at T2 in any outcome with the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of 0.000, there were several outcomes for which the difference between the MBSR and the control group would have been significant at the conventional level of p ≤ .05."
The same is true for the SKY group and the MBSR group.
"Because the current study is underpowered to detect effects at the stricter level of significance, this study warrants replication with larger sample sizes."
"Based on these indications, it is worth investigating whether all of the interventions might show additional benefits."
The American Council for Education emphasizes the cost- benefit analyses of offering mental health programming to reduce costs related to dropout and earnings (29).
"Counseling expenses for an average public 4-year college or university serving 15,000-20,000 students, with an average staff of 10 full-time staff, are around $1,560,000 (including salary, benefits, operational costs and professional development) (5)."
"Programs like SKY, EI or MBSR can be taught in a large group format by trainers hired as lecturers."
"The cost of hiring lecturers per year is low [average salary during the academic year 2016–17 was $58,749; (97)]."
"Given that these programs offer empirically validated education that leads to observable improvements in well-being and mental health, and given the affordability of their delivery, universities could stand to benefit financially from including them in their curricula."
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
"Although effect sizes were consistent and in expected directions across many outcome variables, group sizes were small."
"Due to randomization and dropout, group sizes were also uneven."
There was also low internal consistency of the dimensions that make up the Ryff Scale of Psychological Well-Being.
Replications with larger samples and group sizes are recommended.
"Moreover, future research should include clinical and biological measures in addition to self-report."
"Whereas the 10-hour pilot study showed no effects, the 30- hour program with required at-home practice did."
The previous null findings may indicate that the amount of training hours used in this study should not be reduced in future studies and in trainings implemented in colleges and universities.
Further research could also examine the replicability of these findings for online delivery of these programs.
"With the modest effects of psychoeducation-only programs for students (as discussed in the introduction), the integrative format of the workshops studied here, which include both skill- building and group dynamics, may be critical for the effectiveness of the programs (34)."
"In addition, future research should investigate mechanisms responsible for the effects of SKY and EI and interactive effects of different curricula components."
It is unclear whether the results would differ if the program structure and incentivization process were altered.
Future research may also consider the role of personality traits or a natural propensity toward well-being on outcomes.
Participants were restricted to undergraduate students from a particularly competitive university in the United States.
"Replicating the study across a variety of campuses and cultural contexts and including additional student populations, such as graduate students, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the interventions."
"Moreover, the findings should be considered in relation to the large number of outcome measures, which necessitated correction for multiple comparisons."
Inactive control groups make it difficult to determine whether the effect of a given intervention is due to content alone (35).
Future studies should include an active control group.
"In sum, this study is one of the first to offer an evaluation of several recommendable and effective protocols for university administrators."
"Given the growing mental health crisis among college-aged students and increasing demand for university campus mental health services, there is an urgent need for cost-effective and preventative ways to address the problem."
"Providing preventative skills-building psychoeducational programs such as SKY and EI, as a supplement to standard care, may help buffer students’ mental health and well-being while providing relief from the financial and counseling burden on universities."

What is mental health?
"Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being."
"It affects how we think, feel, and act."
"It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices.1 Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood."

Why is mental health important for overall health?
Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health.
"For example, depression increases the risk for many types of physical health problems, particularly long-lasting conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke."
"Similarly, the presence of chronic conditions can increase the risk for mental illness.2"

Can your mental health change over time?
"Yes, it’s important to remember that a person’s mental health can change over time, depending on many factors."
"When the demands placed on a person exceed their resources and coping abilities, their mental health could be impacted."
"For example, if someone is working long hours, caring for a relative, or experiencing economic hardship, they may experience poor mental health."

How common are mental illnesses?
Mental illnesses are among the most common health conditions in the United States.
More than 1 in 5 US adults live with a mental illness.
"Over 1 in 5 youth (ages 13-18) either currently or at some point during their life, have had a seriously debilitating mental illness.5"
"About 1 in 25 U.S. adults lives with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression.6"

What causes mental illness?
There is no single cause for mental illness.
"A number of factors can contribute to risk for mental illness, such as"
""
"Adverse Childhood Experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse (for example, child abuse, sexual assault, witnessing violence, etc.)"
"Experiences related to other ongoing (chronic) medical conditions, such as a traumatic brain injury, cancer, or diabetes"
Biological factors or chemical imbalances in the brain
Use of alcohol or drugs
Having feelings of loneliness or isolation
"People can experience different types of mental illnesses or disorders, and they can often occur at the same time."
Mental illnesses can occur over a short period of time or be episodic.
This means that the mental illness comes and goes with discrete beginnings and ends.
Mental illness can also be ongoing or long-lasting.
There are more than 200 types of mental illness.
Some of the main types of mental illness and disorders are listed here.

Being mentally healthy during childhood means reaching developmental and emotional milestones and learning healthy social skills and how to cope when there are problems.
"Mentally healthy children have a positive quality of life and can function well at home, in school, and in their communities."
"Mental disorders among children are described as serious changes in the way children typically learn, behave, or handle their emotions, which cause distress and problems getting through the day."
Many children occasionally experience fears and worries or display disruptive behaviors.
"If symptoms are serious and persistent and interfere with school, home, or play activities, the child may be diagnosed with a mental disorder."
Mental health is not simply the absence of a mental disorder.
"Children who don’t have a mental disorder might differ in how well they are doing, and children who have the same diagnosed mental disorder might differ in their strengths and weaknesses in how they are developing and coping, and in their quality of life."
Mental health as a continuum and the identification of specific mental disorders are both ways to understand how well children are doing.
What are common childhood mental disorders?
"Among the more common mental disorders that can be diagnosed in childhood are attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety (fears or worries), and behavior disorders."

What are the symptoms of childhood mental disorders?
"Symptoms of mental disorders change over time as a child grows, and may include difficulties with how a child plays, learns, speaks, and acts, or how the child handles their emotions."
"Symptoms often start in early childhood, although some disorders may develop during the teenage years."
"The diagnosis is often made in the school years and sometimes earlier; however, some children with a mental disorder may not be recognized or diagnosed as having one."
Can childhood mental disorders be treated?
Childhood mental disorders can be treated and managed.
There are many treatment options based on the best and most current medical evidence.
"Parents and doctors should work closely with everyone involved in the child’s treatment—teachers, coaches, therapists, and other family members."
"Taking advantage of all the resources available will help parents, health professionals, and educators guide the child towards success."
Early diagnosis and appropriate services for children and their families can make a difference in the lives of children with mental disorders.

"Find a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist, a search tool by the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies."
"If you need help finding treatment facilities, visit FindTreatment.gov."
Who is affected?
Childhood mental disorders affect many children and families.
Boys and girls of all ages and ethnic/racial backgrounds and living in all regions of the United States experience mental disorders.
"Based on the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine report, which gathered findings from previous studies, it is estimated that in 2007, 13–20% of children living in the United States (up to 1 out of 5 children) experienced a mental disorder in a given year, costing individuals, families, and society an estimated $247 billion per year."
What is the impact of mental disorders in children?
Mental health is important to overall health.
Mental disorders are chronic health conditions—conditions that last a long time and often don’t go away completely—that can continue through the lifespan.
"Without early diagnosis and treatment, children with mental disorders can have problems at home, in school, and in forming friendships."
"Mental disorders can also interfere with a child’s healthy development, causing problems that can continue into adulthood."
Public health includes mental health
"Supporting children’s mental health also includes making sure children meet developmental milestones, understanding what to do when there is a concern, supporting positive parenting strategies, and improving access to care."
CDC works with partner agencies to better understand mental health and mental disorders and the impact they have on children.

What you can do
Parents: You know your child best.
"Talk to your child’s healthcare professional if you have concerns about the way your child behaves at home, in school, or with friends."
Youth: It is just as important to take care of your mental health as it is to take care of your physical health.
"If you are angry, worried or sad, don’t be afraid to talk about your feelings and reach out to a trusted friend or adult."
Healthcare professionals: Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment based on updated guidelines are very important.
There are resources available to help diagnose and treat children’s mental disorders.
Teachers/school administrators: Early identification is important so that children can get the help they need.
Work with families and healthcare professionals if you have concerns about the mental health of a child in your school.
Providing care and services to the public can be demanding and stressful.
"Work-related stress can affect your well-being, the care and services you give to others while doing your job, and the well-being of the people you care about outside of work."
"It is critical for managers and supervisors to recognize what stress looks like, and to change organizational policies and practices to reduce job-related stress."
It is also helpful for managers and workers alike to learn how to cope with stress and know where to go for help.
Recognize the symptoms of stress in yourself and others.
"Feeling irritated, angry, or in denial"
"Feeling uncertain, nervous, or anxious"
Feeling helpless or powerless
Lacking motivation
"Feeling tired, overwhelmed, or burned out"
Feeling sad or depressed
Having trouble sleeping
Having trouble concentrating
Know about burnout:
""
Workers experiencing burnout often feel exhausted and cynical.
"Working in a distressing environment can strain a person’s physical, emotional, and psychological well-being."
Workers with burnout are more likely to experience mental health conditions like anxiety and depression.
Burnout can also impact employee retention.
Workers experiencing burnout may be less engaged at work and choose to leave their job or their profession altogether.
Tips for managers and supervisors:
Managers and supervisors can play a big role in reducing and preventing job-related stress.
Burnout can develop when workers have too many demands that require effort and not enough resources to meet those demands.
"While individual-level solutions like self-care and resilience training can help, changing workplace policies and practices the best way to address burnout."
CDC has an online training for public health supervisors and managers: Understanding and Preventing Burnout among Public Health Workers.
Participants learn strategies to prioritize employee health and well-being and prevent burnout.
"Managers and supervisors can use a Total Worker Health® approach to implement policies, practices, and programs."
A program to reduce work-related stress might include:  
""
"Implement organizational and management policies that eliminate the root causes of stress, such as excess demands or workplace bullying."
Also implement policies that provide workers with increased flexibility and control over their work and schedules.
Provide training for supervisors on strategies to reduce stressful working conditions.
Provide training and interventions to build resiliency for stress management and reduction for all workers.
Provide access to Employee Assistance Programs.
Tips to cope and enhance your resilience:
"Communicate with your coworkers, supervisors, and employees about job stress."
Talk openly about how job stress is affecting your well-being.
Identify factors that cause stress and work together to identify solutions.
Ask about how to access mental health resources in your workplace.
Identify and accept those things which you do not have control over.
"Take breaks during your shift to rest, stretch, or check in with supportive colleagues, coworkers, friends and family."
"When away from work, get exercise when you can."
Spend time outdoors either being physically activity or relaxing.
Do things you enjoy during non-work hours.
Learn healthy ways to cope with stress.
Good Mental Health Care:
"What It Is, What It Is Not &"
What It Could Be
What makes for good mental health care?
"What are the barriers to good care and,"
"when they can be overcome, what accounts for successful treatment?"
"What does successful treatment and care, in fact, mean?"
Can they mean different things to different people?
"If so, how can we think about them in a practical way that is useful to"
"patients, families, and clinicians?"
"On the one hand, from work in fields as various as"
"neuroscience, clinical psychology, and anthropology, we are learning (and rediscovering) more and more about how the human mind works and the many ways that"
psychological suffering can be preempted and treated.
"On the other hand, in many"
"ways, the mental health care system is either dysfunctional or working against what"
"we know to be best for psychological and social flourishing–the disappearance, for"
"example, of true “care” from medical and mental health care systems."
"In this essay,"
set against the background of diverse perspectives provided by the foregoing essays in
"this volume, we attempt to frame and address some of these basic questions, giving"
"priority to practical, down-to-earth, lay, and professional considerations."
"A person walks into a consulting room (or into a family encounter, clinic, or"
"community mental health center) looking for help with difficult feelings,"
"ideas, or relationships."
Their problem may come with a widely agreed
"upon label, or may at first seem more amorphous."
It may not fit neatly into any
available category.
"It may be difficult to articulate in words for the affected person, the family carer, or the professional provider."
The person may be ambivalent
about classifying their experience as a problem at all.
"In the clinical setting, they"
"meet a caregiver: a community health care worker, a physician experienced in using selective psychopharmacological agents, a therapist of some variety."
Their
"transaction is pragmatic, concerned with lessening or removing complaints and"
controlling unwanted experiences.
That clinical action entails understanding the
"problem as clearly as possible and in such a way as to make available an intervention, a treatment strategy that will maximize the benefit while minimizing the"
harm.
What that strategy ends up being will depend on the nature of the presenting
"problem and the training, orientation, and expertise of the provider(s)."
"A medication may be used, or a certain kind of psychotherapy will be initiated, an alternative and complementary practice employed, or family–and self–care with"
"exercise, diet, and meditation."
"If in psychiatry, another kind of somatic treatment"
may be prescribed such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or electroconvulsive
therapy.
"If in religious healing, prayer and rituals may be undertaken."
"The affected person (patient, client, supplicant) and provider will then discern if the chosen"
course proves helpful or not.
"All of this, and more, is what we are talking about"
when we talk about mental health care.
"From a more academic perspective, the multidisciplinary collection of essays"
in this issue also demonstrates how mental health care encompasses a wide range
of conditions and possible interventions.
Different disciplinary perspectives and
"theoretical frameworks can formulate the same problem in sometimes very different ways and can, therefore, lead to different approaches to treatment that may"
complement one another or be mutually incompatible (see the essay by Allan V.
Horwitz and Jerome C. Wakefield in this issue).1
 While each perspective lays out
"a problem to be addressed theoretically in its own way, there will be some conditions–usually those with more dramatic or acute signs and symptoms–that"
nearly all frameworks regard as mental health issues.2 Other conditions with
more widely shared or subtle characteristics may be thought of by some as within a certain normal range that places them outside the purview of mental health
care.
Some basic theoretical frameworks represented in this Dædalus issue are:
"biochemical, neurological, genetic, psychological (cognitive, emotional), psychodynamic/psychoanalytic, interpersonal, social constructionist (cultural, moral),"
"and social structural (poverty, class, race)."
"While some authors are clearly grounded in one or several distinct perspectives, in clinical practice there is always present a blend of influence idiosyncratic to a particular provider, institution, and political economic system."
In other
"words, the theoretical distinctions between different fields and subfields, as well"
"as professions and institutions, have real effect and implications for practice, yet"
are never wholly representative of day-to-day clinical reality.3
" When patient, family, and community perspectives and practices are given primacy in mental health"
"care–as they must, because they constitute most of care–the realities of what"
such care is about become both more diverse and more widely shared.
Think of
"the emergent perspective of neurodiversity as a popular replacement for professional caregivers’ orientation to pathology in an effort to reduce stigma and mainstream differences.4 Research and practice, theory and technique, are forever"
joined and forever in tension with one another.
"In psychiatry and psychology, because we do not understand the etiology of"
"psychological problems in the way that we understand the cause of bacterial in fection or bone fractures, we also do not understand exactly how our interventions help, or why they help some people in certain ways and not others."
The
"treatment of mental distress and illness, whether by medication or psychotherapy is, therefore, still fundamentally empirical.5"
 And yet that empirical outcome
is so connected to different human interests and perspectives that caregiver and
"care-recipient (as well as family, friends, and other providers) may not fully agree"
on the outcome.
Let us return to the person in the consulting room.
Their problem has been presented and formulated in some manner and an intervention (or nonintervention)
has been decided upon.
"Treatment has begun, and while these more or less explicit"
"steps are taken and evaluated, something else is happening in the clinical encounter (something that happens to some extent in every clinical encounter): a basic"
"human interaction is unfolding and a caregiving relationship of some sort is developing in the context of all the conscious and unconscious hopes, expectations,"
"uncertainties, and fears of both the affected person and the provider, the patient"
and the healer.
This is the heart of care: the intersubjective caregiving-receiving
reciprocity.
The therapeutic power of this relationship in all fields of medicine has
been well known for a very long time.
"When we speak of “bedside manner,” “the"
"healer’s art,” “the placebo response,” or “therapeutic empathy and presence,” we"
are drawing on this relationship.6 Today it is given increasing attention in the medical school curriculum.
Efforts to incorporate language and lessons from the humanities and arts into medical training illustrate the sense that there is something
clinically valuable to being a human provider with a human patient.7
" These endeavors tend to run aground, however, when efforts are made to standardize clinical interactions and enfold them into any sort of algorithmic approach, such as"
those entailed by bureaucratic uses of one-size-fits-all technology and the structural demands of our “era of high throughput” of patients and procedures.8
"Measures of true caregiving processes like the quality of therapeutic relationships, the actual time spent interacting, the practitioner’s skills (or lack thereof ) in"
"listening and communicating, their emotional support, their presence as an ethical and spiritual act, their clinical judgment and therapeutic decision-making–"
all fundamental to quality care–routinely go unexamined in everyday clinical
work.
We measure none of these crucial elements of care in health care systems.
"Hence, evidence of the quality of caregiving in psychiatry, other mental health"
"professions (except for a few kinds of psychotherapy research), and indeed every other area of medicine is essentially nonexistent."
"Instead, clinics and hospitals use a bureaucratic sleight of hand: they evaluate institutional efficiency–the"
"cost, speed, and other bureaucratic measures of the performance and outcomes of"
services–as a substitute for care and call it quality.
The actual day-to-day quality
"of care in mental health, as in the rest of the field of health, is largely unknown because it is not directly, routinely, or systematically examined."
"To complicate things further, there are several different ways one might look"
"at and, therefore, evaluate quality in mental health care: there is quality as defined"
"by different academic and industrial research perspectives, quality as defined by"
"the latest practice standards of each profession and institution, and quality as the"
usefulness (or not) to a particular person in a particular context of care and treatment relationship.
"The first will always be different depending on what theoretical and methodological perspective is taken (such as biological, psychological, social constructionist, social structural)."
"The second will also be different depending on the official professional, institutional, or governmental guidelines."
The
"third is more likely to be shared, and may even contain a certain universality, owing to the practical, down-to-earth human activity of caregiving and receiving."
It
"is the abidingly human parts in the individual, family, and community context of"
care that we primarily concern ourselves with in this essay.
This is care as exemplified in this volume by Kay Redfield Jamison’s descriptions of the lived experiences
"of suffering and healing among those with mood disorders, and Vikram Patel and"
Atif Rahman’s research on the effectiveness and potential of therapy by lay counselors and community caregivers.9
We generally assume that therapists are therapeutic.
There is a good
"deal of quantitative and qualitative data about the treatment outcomes of particular kinds of therapy, and much reportage about their"
"practices, to suggest they are.10 And yet we also find regular accounts in the media and in the rapidly expanding genre of patient and family member narratives"
"that raise serious questions about just how good, in general, the quality of care"
for patients’ mental health really is.11 As clinicians who work in this remarkably
"varied field, we are aware that many psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and nurses, occupational therapists, and practitioners from"
other disciplines often aspire to clinical excellence.
"But how often does aspiration translate into high-quality care as assessed by patients, families, and professionals themselves, let alone independent observers, the state, or health insurance companies?"
"Because we are also acutely aware of all the financial, bureaucratic, and professional barriers to quality care, we must admit we simply do not"
know enough about quality of care in the mental health field.
What we do know
is simultaneously promising and discouraging.
And we must recognize openly
that much of what we identify as care does not lend itself to the kind of quantification and evaluation that are used in academic medical and public health policy.
But the fact that the subtleties of individual relationships cannot be adequately
assessed by a randomized controlled trial does not mean that they are not important.
"There are other, related, essential elements of care that can be measured"
"more readily, such as actual time devoted to face-to-face patient care, the pattern"
"and level of communication, and the minimization of bureaucratic distractions and financial conflicts of interest, as well as the reduction of ethical failings and"
iatrogenic harm.
"It is past time to implement across the broad range of practices and practitioners the elements of high quality of care, especially for those most vulnerable"
and marginal who simultaneously have the greatest need and the fewest resources.
Access without adequate quality of services is as unacceptable as are efforts at
prevention without treatment.
"Looking at our own profession, psychiatry, we recognize that in clinics and"
"training programs across the United States, clinicians and trainees are spending"
hours and hours each day in front of computer screens entering information that
has very little to do with the clinical reality of the patients they are treating.
It is a
"serious crisis in psychiatry, as in the rest of medicine."
The union of insurance- and
liability-driven clinical documentation and electronic medical records that function as billing platforms and convert clinicians into accountants has grown into a
bureaucratic nightmare that distorts clinical realities and wastes precious time.12
Particularly troubling is the sheer hours spent in training and practice on clinically irrelevant documentation that could (and should) be spent providing care; it
"discourages clinicians and, at worst, makes them feel alienated from their desire"
to take part in high-quality clinical practice–alienation that is so common it has
received extensive media attention as an epidemic of “burnout.” Burnout results
in poorer education and socialization for failure.13
The model of the mind implicit in this one-size-fits-all systems approach to
"psychiatric practice is a false one: unidimensional; without nuances, uncertainty, or contradiction; without humanity."
That model does damage to both patients
and clinicians.
"Again, the beneficiaries are insurance companies, those invested in"
"growing hospital bureaucracies, and pharmaceutical companies who lobby for their"
overpriced products to be more integrated into treatment algorithms across entire
health care systems.
"Prioritizing money, not care, has led us to this state of affairs."
Even supposedly nonprofit institutions function as businesses seeking profits: a
2016 study found that seven of the ten most profitable hospitals in the United States
"were nonprofits.14 In psychiatry, researchers who should know better, and whose"
"findings may even have made them think twice, have gone along with this commercially driven approach because it not only improves hospital finances, but supports"
their own publication record and career advancement.
They have removed the psyche from psychiatry and in its place given primacy to economic growth over subjective and contextual good.
It has not been beneficial for those people who have had
"the most at stake: patients, families, communities, and ordinary practitioners.15 Sad"
"to say, academic psychiatry by and large has offered little resistance."
"Instead, it has"
been all too eager to abandon the complexity of the human reality of care in favor of
"the artificial stamp of approval of “evidence-based science” (read, efficiency-based"
metrics) from industries whose primary objective is financial gain.
Consider the observations made by Steven Hyman; Anne Harrington; Isaac R.
"Galatzer-Levy, Gabriel J. Aranovich, and Thomas R. Insel; Helena Hansen, Kevin J."
"Gutierrez, and Saudi Garcia; and Gary Belkin, among others, in this issue of"
Dædalus.
17 Despite many remarkable discoveries in basic neuroscience about the
"workings of the brain, the efficacy of everyday treatment for mental illness has"
"not changed much over the past four decades, and once lofty promises remain unfulfilled."
Diagnosis is always a problem (due in large part to the subjective and
still mysterious nature of most psychological issues) and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association has become an everexpanding catalog of arbitrary conditions or “disorders” defined by symptom
"checklists, many of which are so lacking in evidence for underlying structure that"
the entire diagnostic system has been rejected by neurobiologists.18
There are also concerns on the treatment side of mental health practice.
That
psychotherapy has outcomes that are better or similar to those for medication is
a huge consideration.19 That relatively simple psychotherapy delivered by community peers with limited training is just as effective as any other treatment for
certain mental health problems calls into question what the mental health system
in every society should look like.
And that developments in neuroscience now emphasize two key features of mental life–unconscious processing and the primacy
"of feelings–signifies that we are in many ways catching up to a conception of human experience that has long been explored in art, music, literature, and psychodynamic psychology.20"
"When taken altogether, it is no longer surprising that the whole superstructure"
of our mental health care system seems profoundly stuck.
The widespread efforts
to turn mental health care into something approximating routine blood pressure
management or antimicrobial treatment are at odds with the state of our current
"understanding of causes and effects, the emergent pictures of the way the mind"
"works, and our sense of what is decent, ethical practice."
Small wonder we may not
be getting the results we say we want.
And small wonder that psychiatry residents
and other trainees are feeling dispirited by a system and an administrative apparatus that seem to deny the existence of the very conflicts and complexities that are
"causing, or at least exacerbating, the suffering of our patients."
"The place of psychiatry, and by extension a medical approach to mental"
"health problems, may well have to become a great deal smaller in the future in comparison with the greater mental health care system, as Hansen"
"and colleagues suggest in their essay.21 Their advocacy for a public health harmreduction approach to syndemics of substance abuse, suicide, and homelessness strikes us as the right track."
"So, too, does Patel and Rahman’s promulgation"
"of a much larger role for community health caregivers in the delivery of psychotherapeutic interventions for depression, anxiety, trauma, and other common mental health problems.22 For example, the available evidence suggests that half of all"
"cases of depression are relatively less severe and respond well to self- and family-care practices, including exercise, diet, interpersonal support, and meditation."
"From a public health standpoint, then, professional care of depression, like that of"
"other common mental health problems, should be focused on those more-serious"
chronic cases that do not respond to these first-line interventions and that require
"expert treatment, including medication and other somatic therapies, as well as"
more sophisticated and intensive forms of psychotherapy.23 The same case can be
"made for a much narrower, limited, and highly specialized role for psychiatry (and"
"clinical psychology) as a referral back-up for mental health care delivered by primary care physicians, nurses, and community care workers."
The same specialized
back-up would be appropriate for public health harm-reduction services aimed
"at reducing domestic violence, racial violence, and other forms of violence-based"
"trauma, as well as suffering due to natural disasters that are increasing owing to climate change, as is addressed in this volume in the essays by Jeffrey W. Swanson and"
"Mark L. Rosenberg, Joseph P. Gone, and Hansen, Gutierrez, and Garcia.24"
"On the other hand, or perhaps even alongside such constrictions, there are"
ways in which the field of clinical psychiatry could expand.
"In academic and other medical institutions that continue to pursue a genuine interest in the improvement of care across departments, psychiatry could be a model and active consultation resource for understanding and maximizing the healing power of the caregiving relationship."
"Even more generally, as the findings of neuroscience continue"
"to grow and attract interest in medical circles as well as the public sphere, psychiatry is well positioned to lead the ongoing integration of medicine with the humanities, sciences, and arts, while also continually articulating and adhering to"
"the boundaries of our current knowledge, a principle that happens to be at the"
core of effective clinical practice.25
The result of such change would be a wholesale restructuring of mental health
care systems.
"Such a new mental health care system would also require systemwide prioritization of quality of caregiving relationships, clinical communication, and the related elements of high-quality care that we discussed earlier."
"Mental health programs, interventions, and policies are still, for the most part,"
"designed and implemented as though mental health problems are there just waiting to be fixed, figured out, or eliminated with the correct medication or therapy."
"As though our internal divisions and self-deceptions, with their close connections"
"to our local cultural worlds and their strains and conflicts, were just superficial"
cracks in the inner veneer of otherwise perfectly consistent and coherent psyches
and smooth social relationships.
It is an arresting irony that the field of mental
"health has so much difficulty encompassing the unconscious–part of our everyday contexts of lived experience with all its familiar paradox, ambivalence, and"
confusion.
"Still, on a practical level, not all or perhaps even most causes of psychological problems are most usefully traced to unconscious conflicts or divisions within the self."
Some should be approached and primarily understood from a genetic
perspective.
Some are most usefully seen as interpersonal issues.
Some post viral.
Some neurodegenerative.
Some deeply social-structural as the result of grinding
"poverty and everyday assaults of racism, as illustrated in the essays by Jonathan M."
"Metzl, Gone, and Hansen, Gutierrez, and Garcia.26 Yet everyone still has to grapple with the reverberations of these biosocial conditions in their mind."
So even in
"instances of genetically based conditions or infections like COVID-19, which can"
"affect the brain and have been so destructive of mental health, as Laura Sampson, Laura D. Kubzansky, and Karestan C. Koenen show in their contribution to"
"this volume, the experiences of true mental health care must be suffused with respect for the mysteries and complications of unconscious life.27 The ontology of"
"care in mental health, the being element, not just the knowing element, requires attention to unconscious life.28 That is likely how interpersonal processes, such as"
"the therapeutic interactions of depressed individuals with their community caregiver peers described by Patel and Rahman, have their healing effect.29 It is how"
psychotherapy probably works.30 And perhaps it also helps us understand how
systems of health care that (explicitly or implicitly) deny the divided and contradictory nature of human experience can be so corrosive of real care.
"This problem, unfortunately, is true of all of health care."
Health care systems
"largely limit their vision of patients, families, and practitioners to a simplistic and"
extraordinarily superficial consumer-provider framing that supports the dominant vision of health economists and business interests.
It reduces care to its supply and demand and product-centered characteristics; it is simply an inadequate
"way of framing caregiving.31 It offers only a small space to acknowledge and affirm the pain and suffering of patients, the fear and uncertainty of family members, and the emotional and moral responses of practitioners."
"That is the complex–psychological, social, and cultural–humanity of human beings."
Out of
that human care comes the presence (or absence of presence) of the protagonists
in the hospital’s healing dramas and the reciprocity that elicits and sustains care in
families and communities.32 Care itself is about the work of caregiving through
"acts like supporting, assisting, being there, accompanying."
Because just the opposite of the dominating health policy vision is or should be what psychotherapy is
"about, it offers both a vision and a practical model for the therapeutic relationship"
"throughout medicine and health care.33 Yet, as it runs against the grain of existing health care systems, psychotherapy has been marginalized."
Neither regarded
as efficient or cost-effective enough at the system level.
"Perhaps the kind of robust support Patel and Rahman’s research offers, along with that of others like it,"
will help prioritize a psychotherapeutic framing of caregiving that is more popular and influential.
The dismissive responses of health program directors and planners make it
crystal clear that any serious undertaking to improve the current quality of care
"will require not piecemeal reform, but rather a thoroughgoing reimagining of"
what health care is about.
We must make more central the real needs and opportunities of people who are struggling to find and offer healing.
I
"n the 1980s and 1990s, one of us (Kleinman) conducted research on mental health problems in China."
That research showed a much larger number
of people were in need of mental health care than those regarded as suffering from mental illness by Chinese psychiatrists and other physicians at the time.
The care available then was limited to psychopharmacological treatment given in
mental hospitals or by psychiatrists and primary care doctors in outpatient clinics.
"Subsequently, as it became increasingly possible to have large-scale epidemiological studies, it was repeatedly shown that the burden of mental health problems in China was in the same ballpark as in the United States and Europe, and"
"that like in those societies, it was worsening."
"In China, persons with mental health"
"problems can experience high levels of stigma, and Chinese patients with mental illness tend to emphasize their physical symptoms and seek general medical"
care.
"It was Kleinman’s view, therefore, that the resulting somatic orientation of"
"psychiatrists, which reinforced such somatization, would reduce the likelihood"
that the Chinese mental health care system would develop substantial psychosocial and psychotherapeutic care approaches.
That theory turned out to be completely wrong.
"Over the past quarter-century, there has been robust development"
of counseling and psychotherapy in the popular domain of care in China.
These
"therapeutic approaches are delivered by school counselors, psychologists, and an"
impressive array of therapists of many different kinds.
The popularity of various
forms of what we would call psychotherapy in today’s China is part of a sea change
"in that society that is most apparent among youth and younger adults, but increasingly involves people of all ages."
"The upshot is a mental health system that extends well beyond psychiatrists, hospitals, and clinics while, at the same time, the"
quality of care for mental health problems in hospitals and clinics has increasingly improved.
"This is a development seen in other countries that points to cultural, political, economic, and social transformations of our time that simultaneously seem to be worsening mental health yet also reducing its stigma and creating"
much broader and diversified forms of care that people are seeking out to a much
greater extent than anyone would have predicted.
The late Paul Farmer–an icon of healing in global health–wrote: “The idea
that some lives matter less is the root of all that is wrong with the world.”34 He
was talking about the devastating effects of racism and neocolonialism.
But he
was also pointing a finger at the combined commercial and bureaucratic processes that dominate health care and so much else in the world.
"As Hansen and co-authors, Metzl, Belkin, Gone, and others in this issue show, reimagining mental"
health care in our times must be a call for making care the central value and therefore the measure of health care systems.
"To accomplish that will require responding to poverty and inadequate housing, reforming the failed criminal justice system, and changing other structural forces that treat many people, including the"
"mentally ill, as if they matter less."
"Just as this will require societal reform, it will"
"require support for the complex humanity of patients, families, and practitioners."
Gone’s account of historical trauma experienced collectively and individually
by Indigenous Americans explains why the ever more popular category of PTSD is
inadequate for getting at the incomplete and stalled social mourning and personal
grieving in the face of past and present ethnocide and persistent assaults on Native peoples everywhere.
Based on research and his own experience as a member
"of the Aaniiih-Gros Ventre Tribal Nation of Montana, Gone joins us and many others in concluding that we need nothing less than to thoroughly reimagine mental"
health care systems.
"That critical process of reimagination, Gone goes on to say,"
needs to begin with acknowledgment and affirmation of the more positive and
"uplifting value dimensions of tribal life, which in turn can encourage healing and"
rebuilding of more availing worlds.
The trajectory of such Indigenous care has to
work through loss and mourning in order to offer a new foundation for human
"flourishing that, among other things, undertakes psychic repair.35"
"In this same vein, Finnish-American medical anthropologist Annikki HerranenTabibi deploys the resonant term “resurgent care” to describe how Sami elderly in"
the Scandinavian Arctic teach youth to reclaim and reinvigorate traditional ways
"of caring for disrupted kinship ties, social suffering, chronic illness, disability owing to aging, as well as climate change’s local destruction of the permafrost foundation of their ecosystems, and the burdens of their everyday living conditions."
"Resurgent care becomes more than Indigenous resistance, but an entire people’s"
modus vivendi for working through mourning and resistance to confront social
"and health inequalities, heal and create the on-the-ground conditions for personal and collective flourishing."
"This is a quest for the wisdom to repair, reinvigorate,"
and endure.36
"Social mourning and personal grieving involve the stewardship of memories,"
"which need to be cared for just as bodies are cared for by lay persons and professionals alike, as they ritually transition or are psychotherapeutically assisted to act"
forward.
"Care of memories is the ethical-spiritual-aesthetic reticulum that underpins trust across distinctive forms of mental health care therapies, thereby enabling"
the completion of individual mourning and the rest of the healing process.
Caring
for collective memories at the societal level might offer a means for social care and
community healing.
We have landed on a foundational principle for mental health systems everywhere: care must be at the center and can be mobilized in different ways to strengthen a world or to rebuild individual lives.
Life itself is the soul of care:
"human relationships, presence, the caring for memories, the everyday activities of"
"pragmatic solidarity, accompaniment, meaning-making, and ethical decency."
"Social technologies, including telemedicine, virtual reality, psychiatric medications,"
"and assistive devices, require that human foundation of ordinary life to maximize"
human prospects.
"Political economy and bureaucracy must sustain and strengthen, not weaken, this life foundation of care."
"Policy and programs, as Swanson and"
"Rosenberg show for the crisis of gun violence in America, require care together"
with prevention if they are to succeed.
The upstream sources of our mental health
"crises–poverty, racism, destructive institutional bureaucracy, wanton commercialization–require care and control if social and health disparities are to be reduced.37 That means focusing on individuals at the same time as social conditions"
and social systems.
It also means that health care systems must prioritize care as
"their central value ahead of financial gain, bureaucratic procedure, professional"
"codes, and ideological commitments."
High-quality mental health care begins and
ends with acts of care.
"Renowned Boston therapist and teacher Elvin Semrad is said to have described psychotherapy as fundamentally a process of “acknowledging,"
"bearing, and putting in perspective” things that are, initially, unacknowledgeable and unbearable."
"Embedded in this formulation is the insight that, to"
"some degree or another, our individual and collective suffering and symptomatology come from the seemingly infinite ways that we find to not-know what we"
know.
"We automatically, reflexively try not to know something if it is too painful,"
"too frightening, too developmentally inappropriate and therefore impossible to"
"integrate into one’s growing self, or if it sets up a seemingly irresolvable conflict"
"with other things we want, need, and know.38 Call it a defense: denial, repression,"
"dissociation, projection, whatever."
Our minds can do this sort of thing because on
some level of basic survival it is adaptive; it gets us through but can leave us psychologically mangled.
"This kind of not-knowing happens on an idiosyncratic, individual level, where an event, a thought, a feeling that is unbearable for one person is perfectly bearable for another with different biology, life history, culture,"
and so on.
It also happens on the level of communities and populations.
What else
"is “the idea that some lives matter less” if not a kind of massive psychological distortion, a denial of something that is as profound as it is self-evident?"
So why the
need for denial?
Why is the idea that all lives are of equal value so often unbearable?
"Probably, at least in part, because of the threat this truth poses to so much of"
"how we operate as individuals and societies, because of the incalculable responsibilities and conflicts and complexities this simple fact brings along with it."
"Some of the most foundational work on intergenerational trauma and the repetitive transmission of both dramatic and subtle childhood mistreatment high lights various psychological defenses against unbearable feelings as a mechanism for such transmission.39 We avoid complicated and painful truths by repressing, dissociating, and otherwise deadening our emotional knowledge, and we thus increase the risk of reenacting and engendering the same deadening processes in our children."
"Leonard Shengold and others have called this essentially traumatic process “soul murder.”40 Similarly, Donald Winnicott described the “false self” that takes over one’s life when the self-preservative psychological contortions of childhood have been too great.41 The child, in order not to know what she cannot bear to know, must amputate her whole apparatus for knowing and feeling new things."
She must kill a part of herself in order to survive.
"Gone, in his essay, describes a related process on both an individual and a community level."
"Just as the defensive denial of the basic truth of human equality can result in actual genocide, so can the unbearableness of such historical trauma subsequently create the conditions for “soul genocide” and the alienation from one’s individual and historical identity on a massive scale."
"It then becomes not a question of treating PTSD symptoms in any sort of medicalized manner, but rather finding a way, collectively, to mourn a loss that entails acknowledging and bearing those things that have so far been unacknowledgeable, perhaps even psychologically unrepresentable in thought or feeling."
We began this essay by noting the wide range of conditions and experiences that might be encompassed by the field of mental health care.
"This diversity of conditions, treatments, technical approaches, and theoretical orientations remains and will likely continue to expand."
"At the same time, we set out to identify and articulate some everyday, down-to-earth, universal aspects of mental health issues and treatments that arise from our shared human condition and transcend, or at least should transcend, the innumerable and inevitable conflicting interests of medical finance and economics, publication and promotion incentives, theoretical allegiances, academic prejudice, bureaucratic inertia, and human desire for concreteness and simplicity, to name a few."
There is currently no comprehensive theory of mental illness that accounts for everything we observe from biology to individual experience to social phenomena.
"Fundamental causes for even the most common issues are still debated, elusive, and overdetermined all at once."
"So, we must continue to learn more: more neuroscience, more social science, more clinical experience."
"At the same time, we must recognize that we already know something about what makes for good care and we must promote it."
"We also know how challenging it can be to bear reality, to be honest with ourselves."
"How easy, how natural it can be to curate our thoughts and feelings, our memories, and our theories and policies in ways that are both self-protective and self-destructive."
"Whether a psychological problem arises primarily from biochemistry or psychodynamic conflict, or social conditions, one of the most important roles of caregiving, whatever the technique, is to help one person or many acknowledge and bear a complicated reality that is for all of us, at one point or another, too much to handle on our own."
"This truth is both daunting and hopeful in its basic, unsophisticated nature."
"It is also threatening to anyone (truly, all of us to some degree) and any institution that wants to have the authoritative answer, the right treatment."
Perhaps that is why it keeps getting ignored–or forgotten.
The underpinnings of today’s mental health crisis include both social structural inequities and neurobiological vulnerabilities.
"The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded and escalated a long-standing problem, rendering the mental health crisis and its dangerous consequences visible and exigent."
"We now possess a clearer and more nuanced understanding of the broken mental health care system and its serious inadequacies, as well as its potential for effective caregiving."
"The professional forms of knowledge and practice are paralleled by an even more substantial system of care involving families, networks, communities, and, of course, those living with mental health conditions themselves."
"Even when delivered by community care workers, psychotherapy can be as effective as somatic treatments for some mental health conditions."
Harm reduction and other public health approaches offer means of preventing or mitigating the disastrous human toll of the substance use disorder epidemic.
Social technology offers new opportunities for enhancing mental health and well-being.
"With these informal systems alongside standardized health care systems, the future could realize a mental health care system with much greater potential to avert the worst harms and offer effective care to many more."
Everyone finally seems to get it now.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it so very clear and convincing: we are all vulnerable to mental distress.
"The types may be diverse–depression, anxiety, panic, trauma, eating disorders, psychosis–but the choke, the sting, the fear, the psychic pain and chaos are terribly real and very disabling, and the residual effect of the pandemic on mental health has been enormous."
"For the time being, even the outright discrimination and subtler forms of stigma attached to mental illness have subsided enough to empower more and more of us to disclose our inner struggles and trace their connection to our highly stressed worlds."
"In turn, we learn that there are effective therapies and competent practitioners, only not enough of them."
"And the systems of care are just as problem-plagued, costly, and egregiously inadequate as the rest of health care.1 In high-, middle-, and low-income countries alike, half of the world’s population will develop a mental illness over the course of their lives."
"Worldwide, depression is among the most disabling health conditions.2 Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia are among the costliest health problems to treat.3 War, migration, and the intersection of violence and poverty, especially as they affect women and children, create a huge toll of trauma."
"As does loneliness for both physical and psychic pain, as well as social media for adolescent anxieties."
"The epidemic of substance abuse killed more than one hundred thousand Americans in 2021 through overdose deaths, representing a nearly 29 percent increase from the prior year.4 The intersecting epidemic of suicide may again be worsening.5 The syndemic of domestic, street, and community violence also is neither controlled nor lessening."
Climate change has brought with it the growth of climate anxiety–along with the traumatic consequences of extreme weather events–as yet another mental health consequence of the increasing recognition of how dangerous and uncertain our times are.
"Yet mental illness, which contributes significantly to suicide, has been repeatedly shown by researchers not to be a significant cause of the mass murders that also beset America."
"Guns are.6 So broken and failing are our health care services in the United States for the chronically mentally ill that, in actuality, it is on the streets of American cities, in our jails and prisons, in emergency rooms and primary care clinics where most of those with chronic psychosis are to be found."
"Deinstitutionalization has taken us from too many hospital beds for the mentally ill in the 1950s to far too few today, and it never was followed up with robust community services as intended and promised."
"Globally, low- and middle-income nations spend less than 2 percent of their total health budgets on mental health care, despite epidemiological studies showing that mental health problems are among the largest contributors to the global burden of disease in their countries and among the top causes of disability.7 Between 75 percent and 90 percent of people living with serious mental health problems in these underresourced countries do not receive a formal diagnosis or treatment.8 For the past two decades, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a range of components of formal and informal community mental health services that can be built within and outside of clinical facilities.9 For example, the WHO encourages providing a spectrum of mental health services, including general hospital services, specialty clinical care and support, and psychosocial rehabilitation and residential services, that extend care delivery to homes and public spaces in the communities where people live.10 But what are the most useful ways of responding to the mental health crisis?"
Is it through medicalized mental health care systems?
Or is it via the preventive and harm-reduction approaches of public health?
Or do we need to separate out those problems that are better handled in families and communities from those requiring medical treatment?
"Indeed, is the medical model of psychiatry more availing for ordinary depression and anxiety disorder?"
Or is it more helpful to reimagine these conditions as responses to loss and other types of social adversity that require a different kind of societal response?
Will technologies that strengthen telepsychiatry remake the mental health care system?
And as we seek to increase access to treatment–especially for the poor–what quality of care will they receive?
Have the prioritization of commercial interests in health delivery and a solely economic language of mental health policy undermined quality care?
The essays in this issue of Dædalus do not provide definitive answers to these crucial questions.
"Rather, the authors seek to characterize the many facets of the contemporary reality of mental health in society."
"They present views of where we are, what works, what has failed, and what is most promising."
They also draw on history to explain how we have gotten to where we are and to help us reimagine where we might head to create a more useful future state for mental health.
"We are told, in a variety of ways, how the basic science and clinical disciplines seeking to understand and respond to mental illness and its attendant suffering have fallen short."
"These deficits are apparent across the spaces of psychiatry, psychopharmacology, neuroscience, psychology, social work, public health, and a range of services in each of these areas."
"These essays direct our attention to where and how our current approaches have not gone far enough or have outright failed, what we can learn from these shortcomings, and how we can reenvisage paths toward improving mental health."
"With a particular focus on the social determinants of poor mental health, several of the authors make the important point that the clinical targets of intervention in mental health make up too narrow a scope to be effective in reducing the enormous burden of suffering."
"Across the essays in this issue, regardless of whether the authors examine the targets of intervention, therapeutic approaches and their mode of delivery, or focus on scale and location of delivery, they converge on the conclusion that mental health needs are urgent and will demand a more robust, extensive, and innovative range of responses than what is presently offered."
"This collection is a serious rebuttal and rebuke to a great deal that is ineffective, myopic, and inadequate about the aspirationally allied fields dedicated to understanding mind, body, society, and their interface with mental health and wellbeing."
"Importantly, it also points to remedies and innovations that can retool these approaches and have potentially transformative impacts on mental health."
"Several of the essays contest the adequacy of biomedicine–and the scientists, other academics, and health professionals who operate within its logics–to frame the right questions and to respond to mental distress and suffering that are outcomes of historical and contemporary structural violence."
"They justifiably critique a narrow view of who is authorized to generate knowledge to respond to mental health needs, and ask whose perspectives, voices, and ways of knowing have been excluded."
"Among those who have been disregarded and historically marginalized are communities of those with relevant lived experience, whose exclusion not only replicates the dynamics of structural inequities, but also misses opportunities to integrate cultural knowledge germane to the repair of historical injustices and to the healing of collective harms that continue to perpetuate distress, suffering, and all the injuries of adversity."
We are experiencing a true crisis of care.
"Psychiatrist Thomas Insel and others have described this crisis convincingly as stemming from, among other deficiencies, a lack of capacity of the current mental health system, access to quality care, and social safety nets."
"With deinstitutionalization over the past half-century, there has been a 95 percent reduction in state mental health beds in the United States."
"This sequence of events and its fallout paved an unfortunate path to what has been, in effect, the criminalization of mental illness and the transformation of the criminal justice system as the de facto mental health system.11 People living with serious mental illness are, moreover, among the most vulnerable in our society; on average, they experience a reduction in life expectancy of more than ten years.12 And yet, there are a variety of proven and effective treatments available for treating mental disorders."
"These include not only medications, but psychological treatments, newer biological and neuromodulatory treatments, and rehabilitative interventions, such as assertive community treatment, supportive employment and academics, supportive housing, family psychoeducation, and clubhouse models of care."
"And despite a collection of effective interventions in the United States, with 21 percent of Americans experiencing a mental illness, over half of people living with a mental illness are not receiving care.13 This is in a country with more than 40,000 psychiatrists, well over 100,000 psychologists and other therapists, and more than 700,000 social workers."
The crisis of care is therefore also clearly a crisis of care delivery that requires strategic solutions to restructure the workforce and the way health care providers work.
A human rights approach is a key foundation for further needed change.
"The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, adopted in 2006, is an international human rights treaty that serves as a cornerstone for the contemporary disability movement.14 It has given voice to those who are among the most unheard and most stigmatized, and it has insisted on the protection and advancement of their rights."
"A more recent movement to integrate concepts of neurodiversity and neurodivergence for describing conditions of human cognition, such as autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dyslexia, represents an ongoing evolution toward greater demedicalization of supports for those living with these conditions.15 It is notable that the structural barriers that exist to access safe, effective, quality mental health care are so much greater for people of color and other less advantaged communities, and that these barriers have been both compounded and revealed by COVID-19."
And they remain unchanged in the transition to a postpandemic period.
"The essays in this volume speak to this reality and to the need for new commitments to equity, cultural relevance, and structural competency in addressing it, and a future that will require placing a greater emphasis and priority on populations more at risk in the context of climate change and rapid social change."
Mental health care needs to be reframed to better serve less advantaged communities.
"Mental health care delivery needs to be seen increasingly through the lens of diversity, social equity and justice, and decoloniality."
"Taken together, these considerations are intended to inform our awareness, understanding, and attunement–our capacity to listen–to the emotional and social suffering of individuals living with a mental health condition."
"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted preexisting inequities in the availability of mental health services and raised awareness about the urgent need for functional and accessible systems of care delivery.16 Global locations most affected by the pandemic also experienced the greatest increases in the prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders, which disproportionally affect young people and women.17 The United States saw increases in intimate partner violence, substance use, and the exacerbation and complications of preexisting medical and psychiatric problems–pandemics within the pandemic."
"COVID-19 ushered in a new era of “polycrisis,” which has been described as a cross-cutting, cascading set of global challenges that spans the effects of the pandemic and climate change (for example, droughts, floods, mega-storms, wildfires, and extreme heat and cold) and that, by extension, drives human migration and growing refugee emergencies, conflict over resources, and political instability."
It is now an era defined by growing complexity and uncertainty.18 The manifestations of these inequities have been increasingly identified as requiring urgent attention at local and global levels.
"The order of the contributions to this issue of Dædalus pivots around Kay Redfield Jamison’s account of the experience of mental health problems by individuals suffering from depression and bipolar disorder.19 Her essay brings the reader into lives lived with mental distress and illness, including her own."
"At the level of the individual human being, ordinary mental illness everywhere and at all times is anchored in inner pain and, in some cases, breakdown, and also places great pressure on the family, network, and entire community."
"The meanings and values associated with this core experience, including the experience of treatment, will, of course, represent cultural, class, caste, and community differences that affect the way symptoms (and healing) are expressed, and how their putative causes are understood.20 Nonetheless, there is something abidingly noxious in the experience of mental illness that resists even greatly different historical eras and cultures from remaking these experiences any way their inhabitants might wish."
This makes experiences of healing equally important in understanding how mental health is lived.
"Anchored in such an appreciation of the emotional injury and breaking of the supports in the lives of real people, and how they experience healing, our contributors whose essays precede Jamison’s offer population and societal examinations of mental health."
"These include the epidemiology of mental illness preceding, during, and following the earliest stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the mental health and social disparities associated with poverty, racism, coloniality, and indigeneity, as well as their contributions to society-wide, and even global, morbidity and mortality."
"Substance use, gun violence, suicide, and mental disorders from depression to psychosis are depicted as epidemics in America today."
"And the precarious condition of America’s broken mental health care systems is illustrated, as are failures in their reform."
"That sad and saddening societal reality becomes the basis for rethinking and reimagining what mental health care systems might be if they emphasized public health prevention and continuity of care over conventional clinical models, well-being over pathology, and policies about controlling guns, funding affordable housing, and changing the criminal justice approach to substance use over what we have in place now."
"More specifically, Laura Sampson, Laura D. Kubzansky, and Karestan C. Koenen document how COVID-19 catapulted mental health into a societal priority owing to the overwhelming evidence of its widespread and devastating effects.21 They also demonstrate how a population-based public health approach responds to the mental health crisis in ways that can add to the public good."
"Jeffrey W. Swanson and Mark L. Rosenberg show in necessary detail that while mental illness is a significant contributor to suicide, serious mental illness is not a major cause of gun violence.22 That the latter requires much better gun-control policies is not likely to alter the politics of gun ownership and rights in America."
But it should make the truth about how gun violence and policies intersect more convincing and harder to deny.
"Helena Hansen, Kevin J. Gutierrez, and Saudi Garcia contend that the medical model of American psychiatry has relatively little to offer the crisis of substance use and abuse.23 They argue that an effective response to this worsening mental health epidemic requires an entirely different approach than what is offered by the dominant medical and prison industrial complexes and, moreover, that addressing upstream causes such as poverty, racism, coloniality, and other sources of health and social inequalities is greatly needed."
Their blueprint for a more adequate approach centers on harm reduction as a social movement for health justice and augmenting and crosslinking mental health services with more communitybased programs.
"Jonathan M. Metzl reinforces their perspective with the shocking story of how schizophrenia became medicalized into a disorder of Black men, and how the field of psychiatry turned its back on the racist underpinnings of this extraordinary perversion of clinical reality.24 Not surprisingly, like Hansen, Gutierrez, and Garcia, Metzl calls for a more circumscribed place for psychiatry in mental health care, as well as for much greater attention to the social structural (not just the cultural) forces that need to be addressed through societal change and greater public health engagement."
Both essays show that a sociogenic model of mental health problems and solutions should play a much larger role in psychiatry and in the much broader mental health field.
"Gary Belkin brings further support to this vision of repairing the inadequacies of prevailing practices for mental health care delivery with his dystopic account of the failure of a greatly ambitious mental health program in New York City despite its sponsorship by political leaders.25 The problem here was not with the program’s vision or its objective, which also aimed to address upstream causes, but rather with failed administration and governance, and the persistence of long-standing beliefs about the connection between violence and those experiencing serious mental illness."
"Sadly, this is not a one-off story in the mental health field."
"Joseph P. Gone’s essay is an account of why Indigenous historical trauma is a more effective and culturally congruent way of representing the devastating longterm effects of ethnocidal North American governmental policies toward Indigenous communities than is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)–today’s ubiquitous category for handling emotional and moral injury by the mental health professions.26 Gone writes with outrage (that knowing readers may well share) about how PTSD, and the medicalized interventions it legitimates, pathologizes the individual victim and in doing so distracts from what Indigenous communities could do to produce fundamental change if provided with the necessary resources."
He critiques this formulation for ignoring history and culture and for its lack of an interdisciplinary analysis.
"Turning away from pathologizing language to traditional idioms and methods for cultural revitalization and uplift hold, for him, a greater power for transformation."
All the essays that precede Jamison’s regard mental health as a much wider and more multidisciplinary field than mental illness or psychiatry.
"For the authors, the problems of substance use, suicide, violence, and common mental disorders interdigitate with and result from the social world, history, and political economy, creating profound inequalities and destructive destinies."
Theirs is also a populationbased view.
"In contrast, the authors that follow Jamison pivot to address more highly focused questions about neurobiology, genetics, pharmacology, psychotherapy, social therapies, community-based health care delivery, and quality in mental health care."
"Anne Harrington’s history of the four decades of failure in biological research in psychiatry to come up with new and more effective medications (with fewer side effects) puts into question the very enterprise of psychopharmacological research.27 With so much lack of success, why has academic psychiatry continued to prioritize biological research instead of research on psychotherapy, community care, social epidemiology, or caregiving more generally?"
"Reading her trenchant account does not lead to an antipsychiatry conclusion, but to a rationale for rebuilding psychiatry’s social, psychological, and clinical research, training, and education as part of a reassessment of its place in the broader mental health care system."
"Steven E. Hyman examines the same history that Harrington reviews, but from the more optimistic perspective of a medical geneticist who seeks to improve and develop the potential of large-scale genetic studies to illuminate complex polygenic influences on psychological processes and vulnerability to social determinants of disease.28 He argues that, hampered by a lack of mechanistic understandings of psychiatric illness, previous therapeutic advances have been largely serendipitous or incremental."
"In contrast, advancements in genomic technologies and computational tools have opened new avenues for understanding causal mechanisms underlying polygenic mental disorders such as schizophrenia."
"These innovations, in turn, are likely to lead to evidence that can direct treatments, as in the rest of medicine, to target specific biological processes involved in the pathophysiology of disease–a goal long sought in the biomedical quest for an understanding of mental illness and its treatment."
Allan V. Horwitz and Jerome C. Wakefield take yet another perspective on the social and biomedical aspects of mental health research and treatment.
"In their sociological reading of history, the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders abandoned the wellestablished distinction between normative experience and pathology in depression, which in the past had excluded bereavement for a close loved one and other significant losses in making the diagnosis of depressive disorders.29 For the authors, episodes of depression owing to such serious social losses are acute, and naturally remit over time as precipitating circumstances resolve."
"In contrast, medically significant depressions may be more enduring and less responsive to changes in social circumstances."
"This then is a fundamental distinction between “normal” emotional variation, including depressed affect, in response to and even expected in the setting of social circumstances such as losses and other serious stressors, and pathological medical depressions, which require a very different kind of diagnostic formulation and approach to treatment."
"Intriguingly, social epidemiology in cardiology, oncology, and infectious disease seems to be moving in the reverse direction, implicating social context (and its structural sources) in health inequalities for biomedical disorders from tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS through diabetes, stroke, and heart failure."
"Isaac R. Galatzer-Levy, Gabriel J. Aranovich, and Thomas R. Insel introduce the potentially very important role that digital technologies can play in mental health care.30 They focus on three transformative applications: the use of sensors and artificial intelligence to provide more objective assessments of mental health problems, the development of telehealth services that increase access and convenience for patients and providers, and the creation of digital therapeutics from virtual reality to chatbots for delivering structured therapies."
"These technologies– these tech-savvy authors contend–can also improve quality and accountability, perhaps paradoxically making care more human, while also leading to new concerns regarding trust, privacy, and equity."
"This suggests that a social technology framing–one that requires social science and engineering collaboration from planning, through design to implementation and evaluation–is essential to avoid the unintended consequences found so often in other areas of health technology.31 Surely, going forward, this subject will be at the forefront of questions surrounding what mental health care can and cannot do, and should and should not do."
"Vikram Patel and Atif Rahman draw upon their respective research in India and Pakistan to show that, globally, the majority of persons with mental health problems who now have no access to effective psychological treatments can feasibly receive effective treatments from lay counselors and community health workers.32 This practice–known as “task-sharing” of psychological interventions for depression, anxiety, and stress-related conditions and their precursors–has been the seminal finding of the field of global mental health, informing much work in the field over the past fifteen years."
They demonstrate a paradigm shift in mental health care systems by which even poor communities have the local resources to address mental health problems.
"The upshot, however, is a very different kind of system in which experts play a much more limited role, and local communities become the centerpiece of care."
"There is growing enthusiasm today for this model, not only in low- or middle-income societies, but in American mental health care as well, albeit not yet by the professional guilds and insurance companies that drive the political economy of mental health care delivery."
Effective task-sharing depends on collaboration across provider cadres and systems; and highly competitive mental health markets within which community-based care has been starved of resources for decades may not yet be conducive to this approach.
"In the final contribution, Arthur Kleinman and Caleb Gardner review the quality of mental health care.33 They show that, as in the rest of health care, quality is not directly measured."
"Instead, measures of institutional efficiency are taken to represent quality of care."
"As a result, patient and provider assessments are devalued by health care institutions in favor of bureaucratic and commercial goals, reflecting prioritization of efficiency and financial profit."
"Will digital technologies, the engagement of community-care workers, or any of the other changes in mental health care envisaged across this volume create high quality mental health care?"
"If not, and if an adequate quality of care cannot be sustained in mental health care delivery, what are the consequences for systems and societies?"
And is this situation any different from what is happening to health care in general in the United States and globally?
There is resonance across the essays in this volume of Dædalus in calling for the inclusion of a broader range of perspectives to guide action.
There are still more voices that could contribute invaluable insights.
"First, our colleagues from the Global South have much to add to this conversation.34 By this, we mean to underscore that it is essential to include not just insights that emanate from having engineered workarounds to resource constraints–and there is much to learn from these successes, as Patel and Rahman’s essay suggests–but also perspectives about navigating inequities that apply to resources and opportunities alike."
Unmet mental health needs require even more exigent action in the Global South.
"Moreover, although the most vulnerable suffer the most precarity, the most well-resourced regions are not necessarily in the vanguard of innovative treatment."
"It is incumbent upon us all to learn from, and then enable and amplify, these essential contributions to the mental health discourse to achieve mental health equity that draws upon the expertise of all stakeholders."
"In particular, those of us who populate academic institutions in the Global North can disrupt and begin to repair the legacy of colonialism and privilege that diminishes opportunities for academic participation and leadership."
"When the mental health workforce is considered, the focus is largely on how to expand their numbers, extend their reach and capacities, and enhance their performance."
"These are all important questions, as are various strategies to compensate for these health workforce shortfalls."
A community-based workforce will need more supports than exist today as accepted standards of practice.
"Learning from expertise in community health, broadly, will also be critical."
"Delivering care from community-based platforms, using peer-based supports and counseling, and drawing upon cultural resources are all promising avenues for expanding the capacity to promote mental well-being and to better respond to mental health problems."
The essays in this volume also make a compelling argument for both a broader remit for mental health promotion as well as deeper and more thoughtful engagement by mental health professionals.
"These arguments ring true, and yet how can we square this with another truth: that there are too few health professionals to meet mental health needs–even in enviably high-resourced settings– and that many of these health providers are also under intensifying institutional pressures that compress the time spent in providing face-to-face clinical care."
The professional agency of mental health clinicians is not without its own social structural constraints.
"The challenges faced by clinicians in offering highquality mental health care in high-income countries such as the United States are, of course, dwarfed by the kinds of constraints that undermine mental health clinicians in low-income regions beset by workforce shortfalls, drug stockouts, and inadequate public health infrastructure."
But these constraints are also not inconsequential.
"For example, administrative actions designed to optimize clinical revenue through cost savings and greater throughput of patients, in turn, generate pressures that diminish clinician time to care for patients, or limit the therapeutic options they can offer."
"In some cases, moreover, shortfalls in ancillary health providers and administrative health staff shift low-value tasks to specialized health professionals."
"In an ironic twist, this circumstance reverses the intended direction of task-sharing and undermines care when more highly skilled physicians absorb low-value tasks as ancillary health provider and clerical positions are eliminated or unfilled."
"Factors such as these contribute to health professional burnout, which is prevalent in the United States, may be associated with adverse impacts on clinician mental health as well as the quality of care they provide to their patients, and must be addressed in part at a systems level.35 There is an imperative to resocialize mental health training–that is, to make it more attentive to historical, socioeconomic, and cultural aspects of illness and care–so that we do a better job of providing education for trainees to work with communities."
"Across this collection of essays, there is agreement that meeting the needs of mental health and well-being will require a broader field of understanding, intervention, and response."
"It will further require that we educate and equip trainees so they can be effective and caring, but also that we better prepare them to integrate a more capacious set of aims that both encompass and vigorously redress the social determinants of poor mental health, and redesign mental health care to better emphasize the priorities and preferences of communities being served."
"To do this well, the trainees themselves will need robust support as they undertake careers with an expanded vision of mental health care delivery."
"We have taught courses for undergraduates and medical and public health students at Harvard University on the foundations of global health, psychiatry, mental health, and the delivery of mental health care, in which we have integrated a social medicine perspective to critique and expand the scope of approaches to mental health.36 It is important for all mental health professionals-in-training, early on, to see a world of experience outside the clinic, in order to incorporate a more encompassing model of practice that engages people beyond the formal health care system, and uses the concepts of well-being and preclinical distress on one hand, and recovery from illness on the other."
"A social medicine perspective also alerts us to other potential pitfalls in the field of mental health, as they relate to the unintended consequences of our interventions and treatments, and the various manifestations of biopower–from the history of white supremacy in the United States and its expression in policy, knowledge, and practice, to the role of psychiatric institutions and prisons in asserting social control, to the immense influence of global pharmaceutical firms, insurance companies, and governing professional bodies for each of the mental health professions in dictating the protocols and political economy of clinical practices as they are implemented and managed today."
The field of global mental health has evolved and learned from the experience of global health care delivery for infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.
"We have personally learned much through our collaborations and long-standing relationships with implementers and academics from the world of global health, including our extraordinary colleague and friend, the late Paul Farmer, and colleagues at the organization he cofounded, Partners In Health.37 The benefits and lessons of a philosophy and practice of “accompaniment” that he elaborated stand to offer us much in addressing mental health through presence and partnership with those who are forgotten by society."
"Accompaniment is an essential theory of practice of engagement in addressing clinical and social problems together, over the long-term, and in developing interventions that are person- and context-centered.38 Several additional aspects of Farmer’s legacy can inform our thinking and practice as we consider the essays in this volume."
"From a values perspective, this includes the moral prioritization of the most vulnerable people for the highest quality of care, and their active engagement, where they live, through the deployment of community health workers and other community members to create layers of contextually informed care."
"From a clinical perspective, it means to confront social and clinical complexity and comorbidity head on, to not shy away from providing care for the sickest people, as well as to build effective care delivery systems for those people living with unremitting and severe forms of illness and under conditions of the most vexing social adversities."
"It also means prioritizing the actual care of those people, as well as research that studies that care, as a foundation for the strengthening of the health care delivery system."
"Additionally, from a systems perspective, the financial commitments need to be made for creating the opportunity for the delivery of humane, high-quality, and “person-centered” care.39 That is to say, mental health care systems need to reject what Farmer decried as “socialization for scarcity”–a mindset in which health delivery is adjusted to make do with inadequate resources–and instead marshal resources that are both adequate to meet the full scope of health needs and also commensurate with health care delivery in well-resourced contexts.40 Perhaps most important, as it relates to the challenges to mental health care delivery, is to place effective listening at the center of a moral praxis that prioritizes people who are suffering from mental health conditions, not only as a clinical condition but also due to and greatly exacerbated by well-documented social and structural constraints."
"Among these, we especially view accompaniment as a conceptual framing that can work well to resocialize the conventional construct of health care and broaden it beyond clinical outcomes so, for example, basic needs are fulfilled alongside clinical needs."
"In this way, an expanded scope of care would also address structural determinants of poor mental health that undercut therapeutic interventions in situations of privation, social complexity, and comorbidity: situations that are not uncommon, but are, rather, the norm."
"In this respect, accompaniment animates an ethos of responsibility to deliver the right kinds of care–including prevention and health promotion, as well as clinical care–and to provide it via public health, social welfare, and community-wide systems that have the broadest scope and capacity to reduce social suffering and advance social justice."
"We are living through a truly dangerous time, when conditions in the world are coming together to worsen mental health."
Many more people are waking up to the realization that mental health really matters and must be protected.
The time has come to make mental health a global priority.
The essays that follow demonstrate that we have the wherewithal to act.
"They also describe the realities, possibilities, limits, and major questions that must be dealt with if our actions are to have significant effects."
We hope readers will join us in this still incipient but rapidly expanding movement for mental health.
"If not now, when?"
"Universal, selective and indicated interventions for supporting mental health at the workplace: an umbrella review of meta-analyses"
""
"The current umbrella review aimed to assess and summarise evidence on universal, selective and indicated interventions for mental health at the workplace."
This umbrella review forms one of the evidence reviews which were commissioned by the WHO to develop global guidelines on mental health at work.
"We conducted systematic searches in five bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Global Medicus Index) and included metaanalyses of randomised trials examining psychosocial, physical activity and lifestyle interventions delivered to all general workers (universal interventions), at-risk workers (selective interventions) and workers already experiencing symptoms of mental disorders (indicated interventions)."
"We included outcomes from seven domains: symptoms of mental health conditions, positive mental health, quality of life, work-related outcomes, substance use, suicide-related outcomes and potential adverse effects."
"We identified 16 meta-analyses producing 66 pooled effect sizes of the examined interventions, mostly on symptoms of mental health conditions (n=43 pooled effect sizes) (eg, burnout, insomnia, stress) and positive mental health (n=15) (eg, well-being)."
"Most of the evidence on universal, selective and indicated interventions was focused on psychosocial interventions, showing small to moderate effects across the various outcomes."
"Certainty levels according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) were low to very low in almost all of the examined outcomes."
The results of existing meta-analyses are promising for the use of preventative and early treatment interventions in the workplace.
"However, the quality and certainty of the evidence were very modest, and further research on the effectiveness of these interventions is warranted."
"Globally, it has been estimated that more than 970 million individuals experienced a mental disorder in 2019, with 80.6% of the burden of disease occurring among working-age individuals.1 Common mental disorders, such as depression or anxiety, are one of the leading causes of long-term disability worldwide while generating a serious impact on economies.2 3 In the absence of scaled up treatment, depression and anxiety have been estimated to cost the global economy US$1 trillion each year.4 This is largely due to the productivity losses derived from sickness absence, presenteeism and turnover.5–7 Further, the WHO defines mental health as not just the absence of a mental disorder, but rather a state of mental well-being in which individuals are able to cope with normal life stressors, realise their own abilities, be able to learn and work fruitfully and contribute to their communities.8 9 In this line, positive mental health and well-being have been associated with better social relationships, physical health, job performance and job satisfaction, among others, as well as with impacts on the productivity of organisations.10–12 The workplace can offer a unique setting for delivering interventions to preventing and supporting mental health conditions."
"Given that working-age adults spend a large proportion of their time at work, implementing interventions at the workplace could increase the access and uptake of evidence-based interventions."
"Different strategies can be delivered at the workplace for mental health promotion, prevention and early treatment, depending on the focus of the delivered intervention."
"In the mental health field, these strategies are often classified as universal, selective and indicated interventions.9 13 Universal interventions are addressed at all general workers, regardless of the risk level of the individuals, with the expectation to provide some benefits to all the receiving population."
Selective interventions are targeted to subgroups of populations that are at a higher risk for developing a mental disorder.
Some occupations have been associated with an increased risk for mental health problems because the workplace presents a greater adversity by its design.
"For instance, health workers are a particularly vulnerable group because of chronic exposure to work stressors, showing a high risk for burnout, depression or suicidal behaviors.14–16 Similar concerns have been raised for other at-risk occupations, such as emergency workers17 or humanitarian workers.18 At a later stage of the mental health intervention spectrum, indicated prevention and early treatment strategies are addressed to individuals who are identified as having symptoms from mental health disorders (eg, workers who are experiencing burnout, high levels of stress or depressive symptoms)."
"In all these strategies, the emphasis is set on the superiority of benefits over harms, taking costs into account as well.19 In addition, it is important to consider a broad spectrum of outcomes when examining the effects of such interventions."
"Considering the WHO definition of mental health,8 9 outcomes should go beyond only examining symptoms of mental health conditions and should include also positive mental health and outcomes related to functioning (eg, quality of life, functioning or work-related outcomes)."
"In the workplace setting, outcomes such as work effectiveness or job satisfaction are especially relevant when assessing the overall effectiveness of interventions."
"A growing body of research has examined the effectiveness of workplace interventions for preventing and protecting mental health, while such interventions are starting to be used routinely in organisations."
"Most meta-analyses on workplace interventions are focused on a specific target population (eg, physicians),20 intervention type (eg, mindfulness-based),21 delivery format (eg, e-health)22 or one specific outcome (eg, burnout)23 making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of these interventions across all levels of prevention and early treatment strategies."
The rapid increase of research in the field and the large number of highly specialised meta-analyses highlight the need for a higher level of synthesis.
"Umbrella reviews, which are systematic reviews of systematic reviews, offer the opportunity to systematically present an overview of a research field and identify uncertainties and knowledge gaps.24 25 Therefore, we conducted an umbrella review with the aim of providing an evidence-based overview of universal, selective and indicated interventions for mental health at the workplace."
"For this, we systematically reviewed meta-analyses of randomised trials examining major types of workplace interventions delivered directly to the individuals (individual-level), namely psychosocial, physical activity and lifestyle interventions."
"The effects of these interventions were reviewed separately for each focus—universal, selective and indicated strategies—and summarising their effects on a wide range of outcomes, including mental health symptoms, positive mental health, quality of life or functioning and work-related outcomes (such as productivity, absence and work effectiveness)."
"METHODS As part of the systematic literature searches to support the development of the WHO Guidelines for Mental Health at Work,8 we conducted an umbrella review on preventive and early treatment interventions for protecting mental health in workers."
"We aimed to systematically collect and review the effectiveness of universal, selective and indicated interventions on mental health symptoms, positive mental health, quality of life and work related outcomes."
"Identification and selection of studies Systematic literature searches were performed in PubMed (18 November 2020), PsycINFO (25 November 2020), Embase (27 January 2021) and Cochrane (27 January 2021)."
"In April 2021, these searches were supplemented by an additional search in Global Medicus Index (12 April 2021) aiming to identify records from non-Western contexts, as well as an update of the original searches in PubMed (12 April 2021), which is the database that provided the largest number of relevant hits."
"In line with the WHO guideline methodology, indicating that evidence obtained for the development of guidelines should be as recent as possible,26 we limited the searches to studies published within the previous 5 years (which was since 1 January 2015)."
The full search strings for PubMed are provided in the online supplemental file.
"Two reviewers (CM, AAm) screened titles and abstracts independently and assessed the full text of any potentially eligible study."
Disagreements were solved through consensus or by consulting with a third senior reviewer (PC).
"The following inclusion criteria were used: ► Major type of intervention based on the prevention and early treatment spectrum: (1) Universal interventions (ie, addressed to workers who are not at an increased risk for mental health disorders and who are not selected based on a screening for mental health), (2) Selective interventions (ie, addressed to workers who are at an increased risk for mental health disorders due to the nature of their work, which was restricted to as healthcare, emergency or humanitarian workers in the context of the WHO guidelines8 and (3) Indicated interventions (ie, addressed to workers with elevated mental health symptoms, who are selected based on a mental health screening as part of the trial)."
"► Specific subtypes of interventions based on their content or focus: Interventions had to be delivered directly to (and for the direct benefit of) the individuals (ie, individual-level interventions) and could include the following categories: (1) psychosocial, including psychological interventions, (2) physical activity or (3) lifestyle (eg, diet for health promotion)."
"Any treatment delivery format (individual, group, self-help, etc) was included."
"► Design of included studies: The studies included in the metaanalysis had to be (or at least the vast majority of them; ie, >75%) randomised controlled trials (RCTs)."
We included meta-analyses with less than 75% of RCTs if the results for RCTs were reported separately.
"► Outcomes: Symptoms of mental health conditions (eg, depressive symptoms, stress), positive mental health (eg, well-being, resilience), quality of life, work-related outcomes, substance use, suicidal behaviours and potential adverse effects of the intervention (eg, deterioration)."
A panel of WHO guideline development experts classified the outcomes as ‘critical’ and ‘important’ for each type of intervention (an overview of this classification is available in the online supplemental file).
"We excluded interventions specifically administered to military personnel as this was outside the scope of the WHO guidelines.8 We also excluded organizational-level interventions, the training aimed at improving managers’ or workers’ mental health literacy, return-to-work and gaining employment programmes, as they were part of separate reviews contributing to the WHO guidelines.8 When multiple meta-analyses overlapped completely in a research question (ie, evaluated the same type of interventions, in the same population, and reported the same outcomes), we selected one meta-analysis based on recency, broadness and quality of the review as assessed with AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2)."
"Data extraction Two researchers (CM, AAm) independently extracted the following data from the meta-analyses: target of the intervention (ie, universal, selective, indicated), main types of interventions (ie, psychosocial, lifestyle, physical activity), details about the participants and data involving the effects of the interventions: outcome domain (eg, quality of life) and instrument, standardised mean difference (SMD) and its 95% CI, number of trials included in each analysis (k), p value of the SMD and the heterogeneity statistic I 2 , with its 95% CI."
"When the 95% CI of the I 2 was not available, we calculated it using the value of χ2 and df with the Heterogi module in STATA SE (V.16.1 for Mac)."
"When the 95% CI of an SMD was not available, we reported the p value."
"We extracted outcomes when a minimum of k=2 trials were pooled, with the exception of an outcome with critical importance according to the panel of experts (ie, suicide), for which we presented results derived from only one trial."
Quality of the included reviews The quality of the included meta-analyses was assessed using AMSTAR-2.27 AMSTAR-2 critically appraises core methodological characteristics of systematic reviews in 16 items (online supplemental file).
"Each item is assessed as positive (Yes) or negative (No), with some of them including a partially positive answer (Partial Yes)."
"Two independent reviewers (CM, AAm) performed the ratings, and disagreements were solved by discussion or consultation with a third reviewer (PC)."
"Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system,28 according to the following five factors: risk of bias in the primary studies, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and other considerations (eg, risk of publication bias)."
"The evaluation of these factors resulted in four levels of confidence, ranging from very low (the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimated effect) to high confidence (very confident that the true effect is similar to the estimated effect) (online supplemental file)."
"Integration of findings We classified all the identified meta-analyses based on the predefined main intervention types: (1) universal interventions, (2) selective interventions and (3) indicated interventions."
"We included meta-analyses that were completely focused on one of the types of interventions (eg, a meta-analysis completely focused on indicated interventions for workers with depressive symptoms), as well as broader meta-analyses that included mixed types of interventions and populations (eg, including universal interventions and selective interventions) when separate effect size data were specifically available for each type of intervention."
"Outcomes were classified into seven domains: symptoms of mental health conditions, positive mental health, quality of life, work-related outcomes, substance use, suicidal behaviours and adverse effects."
"RESULTS Selection and inclusion of meta-analyses A total of 15 588 records were identified, and 9928 titles and abstracts were screened after removal of duplicates."
We retrieved 162 full-text articles and excluded 9766.
"The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow chart describing the inclusion process, with reasons for exclusion, is presented in figure 1."
A total of 16 meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria.
The references of the included metaanalyses are presented in the online supplemental file 1.
Characteristics of included meta-analyses The main characteristics of the 16 meta-analyses are summarised in table 1.
The total number of primary studies included in the reviews ranged from 6 to 119.
"The sample sizes varied, with the largest meta-analysis including a total of 10 232 participants."
"We classified 16 meta-analyses according to the three main groups of interventions, with some of the meta-analyses reporting data for multiple types: (1) universal interventions (n=8 metaanalyses), (2) selective interventions, with all identified reviews focusing on healthcare workers (n=8 meta-analyses) and (3) indicated interventions for workers with symptoms of mental health conditions or disorders (n=5 meta-analyses)."
"The content or focus of included interventions varied for the main intervention group (universal, selective, indicated)."
"Psychosocial interventions were the most widely examined type in all three groups, with some broader meta-analyses focusing on any type of psychosocial intervention, while some were more specific to a subtype (eg, mindfulness-based21) or a particular delivery format (eg, e-health29)."
"Physical activity or lifestyle programmes were much less frequently included and were available only for all general workers and for healthcare workers, but not for workers with symptoms of mental health conditions."
"The interventions were mainly compared with control conditions, involving mostly care-as-usual, waiting list and assessment only."
"For 14 out of the 16 meta-analyses, these effect sizes were derived exclusively from RCTs, while two meta-analyses reported effect sizes mainly from RCTs (96% and 77%) but included a minority of non-RCTs."
"In total, 66 pooled effect sizes were extracted from the metaanalyses, 23 for universal interventions, 29 for selective interventions delivered to healthcare workers and 14 for indicated interventions for workers with symptoms of mental health conditions."
"Quality of the included reviews The quality of the meta-analyses varied, although most of the AMSTAR-2 items were rated with positive scores (figure 2)."
"All the reviews provided an adequate definition of the PICO (Participants, Interventions, Comparators, Outcomes), and the vast majority (87.5%) used adequate methods for pooling, took RoB into account when interpreting the results, explored heterogeneity and reported conflicts of interest."
"The majority of the reviews (81.25%) conducted comprehensive searches, described studies in detail and used suitable tools for RoB, and most of them (75%) explained the selection of study designs and explored publication bias."
"Study selection and data extraction conducted in duplicate was reported for 68.75% and 62.5% of the reviews, respectively."
"Notably, only half of the meta-analyses statistically examined the influence of RoB on their outcomes."
"A registered protocol was available for only 31.25% of the reviews, only 25% reported a list of the excluded full texts with reasons and only one explored sources of funding."
The AMSTAR-2 ratings for each meta-analysis are presented in online supplemental eTable 1.
Effects of universal workplace interventions Eight meta-analyses reported on the effects of universal interventions.
"Two included psychosocial, physical activity or lifestyle interventions30 31 and six focused on psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT)-based interventions, relaxation or stress management programmes.22 23 29 32–34 Three meta-analyses focused only on e-health formats,22 29 34 while the remaining seven included different types of delivery formats (eg, individual, group, e-health)."
"Available outcomes included symptoms of mental health conditions (n=14), positive mental health (n=6), work-related outcomes (n=2) and quality of life (n=1)."
"A detailed overview of the effects of universal interventions is presented in table 2, along with the GRADE assessments for each outcome."
"Most of the outcomes were rated as low (12/23) or as very low certainty (8/23), and only 3 were rated as moderate or high."
"Overall, when pooled together in the same analysis, psychosocial, physical activity and lifestyle interventions were associated with moderate and large effects on positive mental health (well-being: SMD=0.51, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.71) and quality of life (overall quality of life: SMD=0.77, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.26) (table 2)."
"A meta-analysis that examined physical activity and lifestyle programmes showed a negligible but significant effect of these interventions on work ability (SMD=0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.22), which was rated as moderate certainty based on GRADE."
"Different subtypes of psychosocial interventions (eg, CBT, mindfulness, stress management, psychoeducation, problemsolving) delivered using multiple formats (ie, individual, group, e-health) resulted in small effects on symptoms of mental health conditions, specifically burnout (exhaustion) (SMD=0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.32) and insomnia (MD=−2.21 in the Insomnia Severity Index, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.36)."
"When examining more specific subtypes of psychosocial interventions based on content, mindfulness and contemplative interventions yielded a moderate effect on general distress (SMD=0.49, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.66) and a large effect on subjective well-being (SMD=0.86, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.53), while CBT-based interventions showed somewhat smaller effects on the latter outcome (SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.40) (table 2)."
"Three meta-analyses examined specifically psychosocial interventions delivered through e-health formats, demonstrating small effects on symptoms of mental health conditions, namely overall symptoms of common mental disorders (ie, depression, psychological distress, stress) (SMD=0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40) (moderate certainty based on GRADE), depression (SMD=0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.35), burnout (SMD=0.26, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.5) and stress (SMD=0.27, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.39)."
"Psychosocial interventions delivered through e-health also showed small to medium effects on two positive mental health outcomes, that is, well-being (SMD=0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.46) and mindfulness (SMD=0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.60), and a small effect on work effectiveness (SMD=0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.3), which was the only outcome in this umbrella review that achieved a high level of certainty based on the GRADE assessment."
"There was no available evidence for universal interventions on substance use, suicidal behaviours or potential adverse effects."
"Effects of selective workplace interventions The effects of selective workplace interventions were available in eight meta-analyses, all of which focused on healthcare professionals."
"One meta-analysis included various psychosocial, physical activity and lifestyle interventions,35 and seven metaanalyses focused on different types of psychosocial interventions, with four of them specifically examining mindfulness and contemplative interventions.20 21 33 36–39 Most of the reviews focused on nurses and physicians, although one review also included social workers, psychologists and other allied healthcare staff.36 All meta-analyses reported on unselected (universal) samples of healthcare workers, except for one meta-analysis20 that also reported separate effects for a subgroup of physicians with elevated symptoms of burnout (which should be considered as selective–indicated intervention)."
"Available outcomes included symptoms of mental health conditions (n=16), positive mental health (n=9), work-related outcomes (n=1), quality of life (n=1), adverse effects (n=1) and suicide-related outcomes (n=1)."
"A detailed overview of the effects of these interventions is presented in table 3, along with the GRADE assessments for each outcome."
"Most of the outcomes were rated as low (7/29) or very low certainty (15/29), and 7 outcomes were assessed as moderate certainty."
"Focusing on psychosocial interventions, different subtypes pooled together (eg, CBT, resilience training, mindfulnessbased, communication skills) showed a small and moderate effect on symptoms of mental health conditions, namely depression (SMD=0.29, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.50) and stress (SMD=0.61, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.07)."
"Moreover, such interventions had an absolute reduction of 2.06% on burnout symptoms (emotional exhaustion) in physicians, reaching a 13.14% reduction when these interventions were administered to the subgroup of physicians that showed heightened symptoms of burnout at baseline (moderate certainty based on GRADE)."
"Regarding positive mental health, psychosocial interventions yielded small to moderate effects on optimism (SMD=0.41, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.72), self-efficacy (SMD=0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.62) and resilience (SMD=0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.65), and a large effect on positive emotions (SMD=0.85, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.53)."
No potential adverse or undesired effects were observed for these interventions.
"Four meta-analyses focused specifically on the effects of mindfulness-based interventions, which resulted in a wide range of effects on symptoms of mental health conditions (table 3), ranging from small on general distress (SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.38) and burnout (SMD=0.26, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.50) (both with moderate certainty), to moderate and large effects on depression (SMD=0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.78) (moderate certainty), stress (SMD=0.55, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.95) (moderate certainty) and anxiety (SMD=0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.39)."
"Mindfulnessbased interventions also showed a moderate improvement in a positive mental health outcome, self-compassion (SMD=0.58, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.97)."
"Work-related outcomes were only examined in the context of mindfulness-based interventions, resulting in a non-significant effect size on work satisfaction (SMD=0.23, 95% CI −0.27 to 0.72)."
"Finally, one review reported the effects of a web-based CBT intervention on suicide-related outcomes based on the results of one RCT, showing that physicians who followed the e-health programme were 60% less likely to report suicidal ideation than the attention-control group (risk ratio=0.40, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.91)."
"There was no available evidence for selective interventions on substance use outcomes and on other at-risk groups of workers, and there was very limited evidence for adverse effects, suiciderelated outcomes and work-related outcomes."
Effects of indicated workplace interventions The effects of workplace interventions delivered to workers with symptoms of mental disorders were retrieved from five meta-analyses.22 23 29 34 40 All of these meta-analyses examined the effects of psychosocial interventions on symptoms of mental health conditions (n=12) and work-related outcomes (n=1).
"A detailed overview of the effects of interventions for this target group is presented in table 4, along with the GRADE assessments for each outcome."
"Most of the outcomes were evaluated as very low (10/14) or low certainty (2/14), and 2 were rated as moderate certainty."
"In employees with elevated symptoms of depression, different subtypes of psychosocial interventions pooled showed small to moderate effects in depressive symptomatology (SMD=0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.54) (table 4)."
"Similar effects on depressive symptoms were found specifically for CBT-based interventions (SMD=0.44, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.61) (moderate certainty)."
"In workers with elevated symptoms of burnout, there was no evidence of a difference between psychosocial interventions and control conditions in reducing any symptoms related to burnout."
"Two meta-analyses specifically focused on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions administered through e-health platforms in workers presenting symptoms of common mental disorders (eg, elevated stress, depression, insomnia) (table 4)."
"E-health interventions showed small to moderate effects on depression (SMD=0.40, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.53), anxiety (SMD=0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61) and on overall symptoms of common mental disorders (ie, stress, depression and psychological distress) (SMD=0.52, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.75), moderate effects on burnout (SMD=0.60, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.88) and large effects on stress (SMD=0.84, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.13) and insomnia (SMD=0.80, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.39)."
"E-health interventions were also effective for improving work effectiveness (SMD=0.32, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61), resulting in a small pooled effect size."
"Regarding specific types of e-health psychosocial interventions, stress management programmes showed moderate effects on overall symptoms of common mental disorders (ie, depression, anxiety, stress) (SMD=0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.85)."
"There was no available evidence for indicated interventions on positive mental health, substance use, suicidal behaviours, quality of life and potential adverse effects."
"No evidence was found for other types of interventions than psychosocial (ie, lifestyle, physical activity)."
"DISCUSSION In the current umbrella review, we assessed and summarised the most updated evidence of universal, selective and indicated interventions for the protection of mental health at the workplace."
"By conducting a systematic search, we reviewed 16 metaanalyses synthesising the effects of psychosocial, physical activity and lifestyle interventions on a total of 66 outcomes, including symptoms of mental health conditions, quality of life, positive mental health and work-related outcomes."
"For universal interventions, there was some evidence suggesting that physical activity and lifestyle interventions could improve work-related outcomes but with very small effects."
"Most of the evidence was dedicated to psychosocial interventions (eg, CBTbased, mindfulness, stress management programmes), showing small to moderate effects on positive mental health and on symptoms of mental health conditions, such as burnout, insomnia or general distress."
"Universal psychosocial interventions delivered through e-health had mostly small effects across various symptoms of mental health conditions and positive mental health outcomes, with many analyses rated as low or very low certainty."
"We should note that the only high certainty outcome in this review was found for e-health interventions, which resulted in a small effect on work effectiveness."
"Regarding selective interventions for at-risk workers (ie, healthcare professionals), most of the evidence was also focused on psychosocial interventions, showing small to moderate effects on symptoms of mental health conditions, and somewhat larger effects on positive mental health, with certainty levels ranging from very low to moderate."
"Finally, for indicated interventions addressed at workers with elevated symptoms of mental health conditions, all the identified evidence was focused on psychosocial interventions."
"Such interventions showed small effects on depression, with low to moderate certainty."
"Indicated interventions delivered through e-health platforms were associated with moderate to large effects in a range of symptoms of mental health conditions, such as stress, depression or insomnia, and small effects on work-related outcomes."
Certainty levels were very low in almost all of the examined outcomes.
This umbrella review revealed some gaps in our knowledge that had not been examined by the latest meta-analytical literature.
"First, the effects of workplace interventions on very relevant outcomes were seldom available."
"Remarkably, work-related outcomes were only examined in three meta-analyses."
"Although many of these interventions might be designed for preventing or addressing mental health symptoms, analysing their impact on outcomes like productivity, absence or work satisfaction is crucial in this setting."
It remains unclear whether these outcomes were not examined in the meta-analyses or whether these were not collected in the trials.
"Other outcomes that were rarely examined were adverse effects, suicide-related outcomes or substance use (not examined at all)."
"Second, we found that there is very little up-to-date meta-analytical evidence around the effectiveness of physical activity and lifestyle workplace interventions."
"Nevertheless, previous evidence suggested that physical activity interventions might be effective in reducing the severity of mental health problems,41 42 and lifestyle approaches, such as dietary interventions, have also been associated with a reduction of symptoms of common mental disorders.43 Mental health promotion through physical activity and lifestyle interventions could be a promising option due to their potential impact on physical health, particularly for workers with sedentary jobs."
"Finally, another gap identified in this review was that all the recent metaanalyses on selective interventions were focused on healthcare workers."
"Future meta-analyses should update our knowledge on other at-risk professions, such as humanitarian workers, police and firefighters."
"It should be noted that by the time this umbrella review is published, more recent meta-analyses might be available in the literature (eg, the meta-analysis by Tan and colleagues44 on emergency workers)."
"Overall, the effects of universal interventions were generally small, which is in line with wider literature on this type of intervention, such as school45 or higher education settings.46 Nevertheless, the use of effect sizes to evaluate the impact of universal interventions presents some disadvantages."
"More specifically, observing large changes resulting from the intervention might be difficult, given that a large percentage of the target population might not have symptoms of mental health conditions."
"Such difficulty is particularly relevant when examining only short-term outcomes, which could preclude the examination of possible incubation effects of the intervention.47 As a result, the effects of universal interventions might have been underestimated."
"Yet, achieving small changes in a large-scale population can have a considerable public health benefit, especially in highly prevalent conditions."
A further problem is the definition of prevention.
"Examining the real extent of prevention of new cases of mental disorders is only possible if samples are assessed for diagnostic status at baseline.48 However, none of the meta-analyses examined this, due to this rarely being established in the trials."
"Prevention research in the workplace should be better supported, given the resources needed to conduct ‘true prevention’ trials (eg, large sample sizes, diagnostic interviews)."
The benefits of workplace interventions could be more substantial if access to these interventions was increased.
"E-health platforms, which were frequently examined by the included meta-analyses, have such potential."
"Outside the workplace, there is extensive evidence on the effects of e-health interventions for treating common mental disorders such as depression49 or anxiety.50 In the workplace setting, the results from the included meta-analyses suggested that mental health promotion through universal and indicated interventions could be possible through e-health."
"Although no recent evidence was found for at-risk workers such as healthcare workers, e-health interventions might be a promising strategy for them given their heavy workload and variable working shifts."
"Overall, across all types of prevention and early intervention strategies, e-health formats have the potential to reduce costs and increase the availability of evidence-based interventions by reducing stigma and reaching populations with limited access to face-to-face interventions, such as workers from low- and middleincome countries/rural communities or home–office employees."
"Nevertheless, these interventions are usually associated with very high attrition rates, which is one of the biggest challenges of the implementation of internet-based interventions."
"The umbrella methodology used in this review allowed us to integrate a large amount of literature, assess it and combine it comprehensively."
"We included universal, selective and indicated workplace interventions, making our findings representative of three important types of preventative and early intervention strategies."
"Another strength of this review is the inclusion of a broad scope of outcomes, involving important and meaningful outcomes such as functioning, quality of life, work-related outcomes and positive mental health."
"This is particularly relevant in this context since it has been suggested that occupational recovery might follow a separate course to symptomatic improvement.51 Moreover, positive mental health outcomes, like well-being, have been associated with impacts on work-related outcomes such as performance or productivity."
52 53 This review has some limitations that should be considered.
"First, we aimed to identify the most updated evidence by including meta-analyses published in the last 5 years, but we may have missed meta-analyses published prior to this time limit."
"However, the evidence of older systematic reviews might be outdated and thus less informative due to the exponential growth of trials in this field."
"Second, we focused on the post-test outcomes of these interventions; thus, future research should examine long-term effects."
"Another important limitation is that the certainty and quality of the evidence were very low, with only 1 of 66 outcomes assessed as high certainty."
"It should be noted that blinding of participants and personnel in psychosocial trials is most of the times impossible, and this results in higher risk of bias scores."
Another limitation is that heterogeneity was very high in many of the pooled effect sizes.
"Moreover, only half of the meta-analyses statistically examined the influence of risk of bias on their outcomes."
"Thus, the summarised effects should be interpreted with caution."
"Finally, given the nature of this study, the evidence that we presented relies on the decisions made by the meta-analysts."
"Therefore, alternative classifications and pooling of interventions are plausible and might change the overall summary of the results."
CONCLUSIONS The workplace provides a promising setting for implementing and disseminating mental health promotion strategies.
"Different types of universal, selective and indicated interventions are available, with variable effects on a range of outcomes that include not only symptoms of mental health conditions but also meaningful outcomes for the employees and the employers (eg, work effectiveness, resilience, etc)."
Organisations should offer interventions according to the characteristics of the target population given that general workers and workers at a higher risk for mental disorders may benefit from different types of strategies.
"E-health platforms are promising in improving the access to evidence-based interventions, reducing stigma and offering flexibility to individuals with irregular working hours."
"Nevertheless, we should note that the quality and certainty of the evidence on the effectiveness of workplace interventions is very modest."
"Further high-quality research is warranted, particularly on workrelated outcomes and including more types of at-risk professions."
Abstract Background: The wellbeing of college students today is at risk because of rising occurrences of mental health issues in higher education.
"Concurrently, undergraduate students perceive engineering courses and programs to be among the most arduous, and least welcoming and accommodating, in higher education."
"Although research related to mental health and wellbeing (MHW) in engineering is growing, a systematic review of this research has yet to be conducted."
Purpose: This systematic literature review identifies and synthesizes empirical scholarship related to the MHW of undergraduate engineering students.
Scope/Method: Specified search terms and inclusion criteria were used to identify 34 empirical studies related to engineering undergraduates' MHW.
Content and qualitative thematic analyses were conducted to characterize and synthesize trends in research quality and outcomes across studies.
Results: Undergraduate engineering students experience a variety of mental health issues that negatively affect their experiences in engineering education.
"Stress is the most prevalent mental health issue identified; anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also reported."
"Heavy academic workloads, sleep issues, and the nature of engineering education culture are identified as impediments to MHW in engineering education."
"Conclusions: Although MHW in engineering is a growing area of research internationally, current MHW research in engineering is nascent and focused on the characterization of student mental health issues."
"Researchers underutilize qualitative and mixed-methods approaches, longitudinal and experimental designs, guiding frameworks, and robust sampling techniques."
"Academic and mindfulness interventions, as well as the use of mental wellness constructs from positive psychology, show promise for supporting MHW in engineering."
"It is known that the onset of mental health issues peaks at the time when traditional-age students pass through their undergraduate education (Kessler et al., 2008; Slade et al., 2009)."
"The occurrence of a mental health issue is characterized by a psychological state of dysfunction that results in distress and deviance from the typical behavioral norms (Worthy et al., 2020)."
"Mental health issues not only threaten the overall wellbeing of college students but also negatively affect students' academic success and retention (Bruffaerts et al., 2018)."
"A recent study conducted across 373 college campuses between 2013 and 2021 suggests that approximately 60% of college students across the nation meet diagnostic criteria for having at least one mental health issue (Lipson et al., 2022)."
"As the prevalence of stress, depression, and even suicidal ideation and action rises among college students (Gallagher, 2008), higher educational institutions are obligated to identify and implement effective approaches for cultivating mental health and wellbeing (MHW) within their student bodies (Flatt, 2013)."
"In recent years, a growing awareness of the declining state of college students' MHW has catalyzed an increase in mental health research that is conducted in higher education (Deziel et al., 2013)."
"This increase is evidenced by the prevalence of several research reviews in higher education on mental health (e.g., Fernandez et al."
"(2016), Nair and Otaki (2021), and Urbina-Garcia (2020))."
"The profound implications of the COVID-19 pandemic helped in accelerating this trend; researchers and practitioners now urgently call for effective psychological interventions and prevention plans (Son et al., 2020) as well as improvements in student accessibility to professional mental health services in higher education."
"Recently, MHW research has extended into post-secondary education contexts, such as engineering education (Korsten et al., 2021)."
"Engineering has earned a (dis)reputation as one of the most stressful disciplines of study in higher education (Danowitz & Beddoes, 2018)."
"Engineering is considered so demanding, in fact, that engineering students often accept poor mental health as an intrinsic characteristic of life in college (Jensen & Cross, 2019)."
"Importantly, research has also shown that engineering students (i) perceive the condition of their MHW to be worse than that of undergraduate students in other majors (Foster & Spencer, 2003), and (ii) seek psychological support at lower rates than nonengineering majors do (Lipson et al., 2016)."
"Yet, despite the growing focus on MHW in higher education generally and engineering education specifically, research related to the MHW of undergraduate engineering students has not been subject of a comprehensive empirical literature review."
"It is widely understood that the existing psychological research related to human MHW strongly prefers theoretical constructs of mental illness over those related to health and wellbeing (Slade, 2010)."
"Historically, mental health research has stemmed from a medical model of health and illness wherein the absence of mental illness is considered commensurate with the state of mental wellbeing or wellness (Greenspoon & Saklofske, 2001; Slade, 2010)."
"Therefore, prior researchers who have investigated MHW were more likely to employ deficit-based approaches that seek to characterize the presence and treatment of mental health problems within a population."
"Alternatively, less attention has been given to understanding the positive aspects of mental health by characterizing and cultivating human mental strengths, which can act as prevention mechanisms for mental health problems within the population (Asghar & Minichiello, 2022b; Slade, 2010)."
"Positive or assets-based mental health research and practice is rooted in positive psychology, which is defined as the “scientific study of positive experiences and positive individual traits” (i.e., human mental strengths) (Lee Duckworth et al., 2005, p. 630)."
"Positive psychology emerged as a distinct sub-field of traditional psychology at the start of the 21st century (Lee Duckworth et al., 2005)."
"Positive psychological perspectives extend beyond diagnoses of mental illnesses by conceptualizing the existence of positive mental health characterized by mental health strengths such as hope, optimism, and resilience."
"Moreover, positive psychologists consider these human strengths to be important components of an overall healthy human psyche."
"Therefore, throughout this article, we use the term “mental health and wellbeing (MHW),” adapted by Asghar and Minichiello (2022b) from Brown (2016, p. 66), to describe our perspective, which considers both the negative (i.e., mental illness) and positive (i.e., mental strengths) aspects of human mental health."
"To our knowledge, the existing research related to MHW in undergraduate engineering education is yet to be systematically synthesized."
"Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the current state of empirical scholarship 2 ASGHAR ET AL."

"By identifying and synthesizing this literature, we not only gained new understandings of the current trends related to the MHW of engineering students but also identified gaps in the current literature."
The current work also supports higher education policy change and/or development by helping to shift attention and resources toward improving MHW among all students and facilitating positive cultural change in this regard.
"In describing our positionality as researchers, we provide a context for the knowledge we produce for the field of engineering education (Slaton & Pawley, 2018) and support transparency in our work for the purpose of gaining the trust of the research community (Hampton et al., 2021)."
The first author is a native of Pakistan who is currently a doctoral student in engineering education in the United States.
He has an academic background that includes post-secondary degree attainment in engineering and also in both clinical and educational psychology.
"His clinical training, which took place at a public mental health facility in Pakistan, provided him with substantial opportunities to work closely with diverse people medically diagnosed with mental illnesses."
"These experiences were grounded in a traditional medical model of psychological health, one that identifies mental wellness as solely the state of a lack of mental illness."
"While conducting research for this systematic review, the first author came across a variety of sources from engineering and other disciplines that have investigated mental health from a wellness, rather than an illness, perspective."
Exposure to these resources has spurred him to broaden his understanding of mental health and to make a personal paradigm shift toward alternative positive psychological perspectives of MHW.
"The second author is a White woman who was formally trained as a mechanical engineer, engineering instructor, and education researcher in the United States."
She is currently employed as an associate professor of engineering education in a college of engineering at a predominantly and historically White land-grant institution located in the western United States.
She has taught undergraduate engineering science courses for well over a decade.
Her engineering teaching experiences include some pivotal moments engaged in emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Over time and particularly during these pandemic-related experiences, the she has witnessed and engaged with increasing numbers of engineering students suffering under multiple pressures (e.g., time, financial, academic performance, familial, health, and wellness) that converge within the context of the 4-year undergraduate engineering program."
These experiences have motivated her to work to understand the condition of MHW in engineering and to adopt and/or assist in developing new instructional strategies able to relieve the burden of stress and anxiety felt by many of today's undergraduate engineering students.
The third author is an Asian male and a Lecturer in the Department of Psychology at an institution of higher education located in Pakistan.
"Apart from being an instructor, he is an experienced researcher in the fields of child psychopathology, developmental psychopathology, and intervention and prevention sciences."
"As a clinical psychologist, he believes that students need both mental and physical health and wellbeing to thrive in academic and social settings."
His positionality in this research is informed by his professional experiences in clinical settings where he has worked with more students from engineering with mental health issues than from any other major field.
These experiences have led him to explore MHW specifically within engineering education contexts.
"As the field of engineering education has evolved over several decades, researchers in this field have successfully adopted and adapted research methodologies from other disciplines to examine important educational and social issues within the context of engineering education (Froyd et al., 2012; Lohmann & Froyd, 2010)."
"The SLR methodology is an accountable, explicit, and rigorous review type (Gough et al., 2017), which was initially developed to guide informed decision making about medical interventions and diagnostic tests (Higgins et al., 2019)."
"The appearance of published SLRs has since expanded into other fields that employ the SLR methodology to identify and synthesize existing findings on a specific research topic, to identify gaps that exist in the available literature, and to guide the direction of future research on a specific topic (Balaid et al., 2016; Borrego et al., 2014; Gopalakrishnan & Ganeshkumar, 2013; Green, 2005)."
The appearance of SLRs in engineering education research (EER) has grown substantially since Borrego et al.
(2014) presented a strong rationale for their use in engineering education (cf.
"Asghar & Minichiello, 2022a)."
"Considering potential reasons for engaging in systematic review processes, SLRs are commonly conducted to describe the state of knowledge on a well-defined topic (Borrego et al., 2014; Petticrew & Roberts, 2008)."
Petticrew and Roberts (2008) add that systematic reviews are conducted “when a general overall picture of the evidence on a topic is needed to direct future research efforts” (p. 21).
These two reasons drove our decision to conduct this systematic review.
"In this SLR, our goal was to describe the current state of scholarship related to MHW of undergraduate engineering students to provide what may be the first general picture of the empirical research in this area and to guide future research in this area."
"To serve these two purposes, three research questions (RQs) were developed and used to guide this work: RQ1."
(Critical appraisal): What is the state of the research quality of empirical studies related to the mental health and wellbeing of undergraduate students in engineering?
RQ2.
(Scoping): What is the state of research practice of empirical studies related to the mental health and wellbeing of undergraduate students in engineering?
RQ3.
(Synthesis): What are the major findings of empirical studies related to the mental health and wellbeing of undergraduate students in engineering?
"RQ1 relates to the critical appraisal, or a systematic assessment, of the included studies to evaluate their coherence with widely accepted norms related to high-quality research (Burls, 2014)."
"RQ2 provides a scoping review, or overview, of the MHW issues and problems and potential causes or correlates, if any, investigated by the included studies."
RQ3 provides a qualitative synthesis of the findings of the included studies.
"Initially, while still designing this SLR, we carried out preparatory searches on multiple databases to assess the extent of existing empirical research studies related to the MHW of students in engineering."
"General search terms such as “mental health of engineering students,” “mental health research in engineering education,” and “mental health of engineering undergraduates” were used."
"These searches revealed that research related to student MHW in engineering has been conducted (i) in interdisciplinary contexts (e.g., Kalkbrenner et al., 2020; Leahy et al., 2010); (ii) with undergraduate engineering students only (e.g., Castaldo et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2016; Rulifson & Bielefeldt, 2020); (iii) with graduate students only, and (iv) with a combined sample of undergraduate and graduate engineering students (e.g., Berdanier et al., 2020; Miles et al., 2020)."
"These initial, preparatory searches were used to develop the focus of our SLR on research related to undergraduate engineering students."
"Source identification To select appropriate search keywords for source identification, a scoping search was carried out in spring 2021 using Education Source via EBSCO and SCOPUS databases."
"Initially, study parameters such as the research topic 4 ASGHAR ET AL."
"21689830, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20574 by National Institutes Of Health Malaysia, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024]."
"See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License (i.e., MHW), the nature of the studies (i.e., empirical), the participants (i.e., undergraduate students), and the study context (i.e., engineering education) guided the formulation of the search strings."
We note that these parameters later became formal inclusion criteria for identified studies.
"Next, we consulted with a subject librarian and two domain experts (one in engineering education and one in psychology) to ensure that we were including relevant and important keywords."
"As we reflected on the experiences of the first and third authors who had experience with medical models of MHW, we paid special attention to ensure the use of both deficit (e.g., mental illness; mental disorder) and anti-deficit (e.g., mental wellness; mental wellbeing) keywords and the identification of studies investigating both negative and positive aspects of psychological health."
The subject librarian was also consulted to determine the search databases.
"Five databases were recommended that are freely available for our use as university employees: Education Source, ERIC, IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, and Scopus."
"With the help of the subject librarian, the search strings were organized according to the requirements of each database as shown in Table 1."
Preliminary searches were made to ensure that the keywords and search strings yielded appropriate research resources.
Table 1 provides the final search strings for each database searched in spring 2021.
Note that we have included the details of the database search field settings to ensure the repeatability of the search process.
"A total of 729 (ERIC, Education Source via EBSCO = 474, SCOPUS = 108, ProQuest = 7, and IEEE Xplore = 140) articles were identified using the search strings provided in Table 1."
Article information for these 729 articles was copied to the Mendeley desktop application and processed to remove 19 duplicates.
"After the removal of duplicates, a *."
"bib file with the remaining 710 article titles and references were downloaded from Mendeley and converted to a *.csv Microsoft Excel file with the help of JabRef, a free desktop application."
"Two additional studies that did not appear in our database searches (i.e., Danowitz & Beddoes, 2020b; Schneider, 2007) were later identified through citation searching (Rethlefsen et al., 2021) via manual screening of the reference lists of identified articles during the full-text assessment."
"Thus, a total of 712 articles were analyzed for inclusion."
Inclusion assessment Abstracts and full articles were assessed for inclusion in a two-step process.
As suggested by Borrego et al.
"(2014), two members of the research team independently assessed every article, meeting regularly over an online video conferencing application to discuss and reach consensus on whether an article would be carried to the next level of inclusion assessment."
Five inclusion criteria (IC) were used to select sources for inclusion in the review: IC1.
"Studies published during the first two decades of the 21st century (i.e., 2000–2020), IC2."
"Studies published in English, IC3."
"Studies published in archival journals or peer-reviewed conference proceedings, IC4."
"Empirical research conducted with undergraduate engineering students, and IC5."
Studies conducted in engineering education settings.
These five inclusion criteria were developed to support our ability to answer our research questions.
"Because we did not know the specific date that MHW research began in the context of engineering education a priori, we intentionally set a wide publication timeframe (i.e., 2000–2020) to capture the earliest articles published as this body of research developed."
We included only articles written in English because it is the only language shared by all authors.
We restricted our review to journal articles and peer-reviewed conference proceedings to ensure that the research we synthesized had been appraised for and met minimum expectations for research quality.
"We included only empirical studies that were conducted with (at least some) undergraduate students in engineering, and we required all included studies to have been conducted within engineering education, and not interdisciplinary education (e.g., STEM) contexts, to maintain our ability to make interpretations and claims concerning engineering disciplinary education."
"Ultimately, to be included, an article was required to meet all five of the inclusion criteria."
"In the first step of the inclusion assessment process, the title and abstracts of the 712 articles (i.e., the 710 identified through database searches and two identified through citation searches) were assessed for inclusion."
"To help ensure that relevant studies were not excluded from the review, all identified studies that were conducted with engineering student participants were retained through the title and abstract assessment."
"In other words, we did not distinguish between studies that might have interdisciplinary student participants or undergraduate and graduate student participants at this stage."
"If it was not obvious from reading the abstract that the study did or did not have engineering student participants, the methods section of the study was also reviewed to understand the details of the participant sample and reach a conclusion."
"As shown in Figure 1, a total of 585 studies were excluded during the title/abstract assessment."
"Of these 585 articles, 582 articles did not include engineering students as participants, and 3 articles were retracted by the publishers as reported by the Mendeley desktop application."
These three articles were excluded after manual verification of their retraction notices in the Mendeley application by the first author.
"During the second step of the inclusion assessment process, the remaining 127 studies, each of which had passed the initial title and abstract assessment, were fully assessed for inclusion based on full-text readings."
The full-text assessment revealed that 93 of these 127 studies did not meet all five inclusion criteria.
"Of these 93 studies that did not meet all five inclusion criteria, 43 studies were conducted within interdisciplinary education (and not engineering education) contexts, 36 studies were found not to be related to MHW, 5 studies did not have any engineering students as participants, 4 studies were not empirical, 2 studies had only engineering graduate students as participants, 2 studies were not conducted in engineering education settings, and 1 study was not written in English."
"The entire inclusion assessment process is visually represented by the PRISMA flow diagram (Liberati et al., 2009) shown in Figure 1."
"We note that in making inclusion decisions, we were initially unsure about the type (i.e., undergraduate or graduate) of the student participants in some of the identified articles."
"Specifically, the type of student participants in four studies (Iraola-Real et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2016; Oner & Kazanasmaz, 2020; Yasdin et al., 2020) was not clear after reading the full texts."
"To make final inclusion decisions about these articles, the first author contacted the lead authors of these four articles via email, or their ResearchGate (ResearchGate j Find and share research, 2022) accounts if email addresses could not be located."
The lead author of Joshi et al.
"(2016) responded that all their participants were undergraduates, while the lead author of Oner and Kazanasmaz (2020) informed us that their participants were both undergraduate and graduate students."
"Therefore, these studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review."
The lead authors of Iraola-Real et al.
(2019) and Yasdin et al.
"(2020), however, did not respond."
"For these two papers, the research team made decisions about inclusion based on other information presented within the articles."
The work of Iraola-Real et al.
"(2019) was included because the study participants were reported as being between 16 and 26 years of age (M = 18.41, SD = 2.71)."
"Thus, the age of the participants led us to decide that there was a high probability that some, if not most, of the participants were undergraduates."
The work of Yasdin et al.
"(2020) was also included because it engaged with a comparatively large number of student participants (N = 112), which made it seem likely that the participants were undergraduates rather than graduate students."
"Finally, 34 articles were included in the review (Figure 1)."
Each of the 34 included articles was assessed for research quality in two ways.
"Because the peer-review process aims to limit critically flawed research from being published (De Vries et al., 2009), the first level of quality assessment was performed by requiring that all studies included in the review to have been published in peer-reviewed conference Records identified through databases = 729 Total records (n = 731) Screening Included Eligibility Identification Additional records identified through citation searching during the full text assessment of included articles (n = 2) Records screened based on title and abstract (n = 712) Records excluded (n = 585) Engineering students not as participants (n = 582) Articles retracted (n = 3) Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = 127) Full-text articles excluded, (n = 93) Interdisciplinary = 43 Not related to mental health = 36 No engineering students involved = 5 Not empirical = 4 Graduate engineering students only = 2 Not in educational settings = 2 Not in English = 1 Studies included in qualitative synthesis (n = 34) Records after duplicates removed (n = 712) FIGURE 1 PRISMA flow diagram of the article selection process."

The second level of quality assessment was performed after the inclusion decisions were complete as we critically appraised the research design of each study.
We note that studies were not excluded from the review based on this second level quality assessment process.
"To conduct the second level quality assessment, the first and second authors extracted detailed information, such as participant demographics and sample size, sampling techniques, data collection methods, theoretical/conceptual frameworks, and author-reported limitations, from the coding table used to quantitatively characterize the included studies (see Section 5.4 for a discussion of coding table development)."
This information was then used to examine the base of literature from methodological and research design perspectives.
Collating and reporting on this information across all included articles as a group to ensure that we reached relevant conclusions and useful recommendations for future work.
The results of the critical appraisal are reported in Section 6 as an answer to RQ1.
Following Denton et al.
"(2020), we conducted both descriptive (i.e., quantitative) content analysis (i.e., scoping review) and qualitative synthesis across all 34 included studies."
"To conduct the descriptive (i.e., quantitative) content analysis (Schreier, 2014, Chapter 12) of study characteristics, we first met as a research group to develop an a priori coding frame."
"The first and third authors then analyzed each article using the following codes: author, year of publication, the country where the study took place, type of article (i.e., journal or conference paper), name of journal or conference, number of participants, participant demographics, study purpose, research approach (i.e., qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods), theoretical/conceptual framework (if applicable), research design, sampling technique, data collection methods, and author-reported limitations."
"Coded information about participant demographics and sample size, sampling techniques, study purpose, research approach, research design, and data collection methods can be found in the Appendix."
Other coding information is provided in sections where applicable.
"After each study had been read and coded by both authors, they met virtually, on several occasions, to discuss coding inconsistencies or discrepancies until consensus was reached."
"If consensus between the first and third authors could not be reached, the second author was consulted to help reach a final decision."
"Once the coding and documentation were complete, the first author constructed appropriate data tables, totals, and percentages to describe the results."
"The findings of this descriptive (i.e., quantitative) characterization of included studies are reported in Section 6 to answer RQ2."
"To conduct the qualitative synthesis, we employed inductive coding and thematic analysis (Saldaña, 2021) to synthesize findings across the included studies."
"To gather the qualitative data used in this analysis, the first author extracted detailed textual statements of purpose and findings from each study."
Findings from each study were read and analyzed individually and then compared across the studies to identify recurring themes.
"Specifically, the first and second authors jointly and collaboratively conducted the inductive analysis by iteratively employing coding, categorizing, and theming processes to the qualitative data."
The authors met several times to compare and refine inductively derived codes and categories and to develop joint interpretations of the data in terms of full thematic statements.
The results of the qualitative synthesis in the form of these resultant themes are presented in Section 6 to answer RQ3.
Conscious and deliberate efforts were made by the research team to ensure the validity and reliability of this systematic review.
As suggested by Borrego et al.
"(2014), at least two independent researchers were involved at every stage of the review."
"Specifically, to decrease researcher self-selection bias that could lead to the exclusion of relevant studies, at least two independent researchers were involved in the abstract and full article assessment of every study considered for inclusion in this review."
"Additionally, at least two independent researchers conducted quality appraisal, content analysis, and qualitative synthesis tasks to mitigate researcher interpretative bias that would jeopardize the overall quality of this review and its reported findings."
"Despite the attentive use of systematic processes, limitations to this SLR remain."
"First, this SLR reports on studies located using widely representative databases that are freely available for use by the researchers at the first and second author's institution (i.e., ERIC and Education Source [via EBSCOhost], IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, SCOPUS)."
"Despite our use of multiple robust databases to locate articles, it is possible that there were studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria that were not identified for this review simply because they were not indexed within these databases."

"See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License The methodological literature indicates that this limitation can be mitigated by consulting a librarian to help develop robust search strategies (Koffel, 2015)."
"Therefore, we consulted a subject librarian from our university library who assisted in database selection and the development of database-specific search strings to reduce researcher self-selection bias in our source identification and assessment processes."
"Another limitation of this systematic review is the potential to include studies that have not ensured quality by following standardized research procedures (Cook et al., 1997)."
"For example, studies included in this SLR may suffer from publication bias if researchers did not report findings when the null hypothesis was not rejected (Hubbard & Armstrong, 1997)."
"We attempted to mitigate this limitation first by including only those studies published in refereed journals and peer-reviewed conference proceedings, and then by carefully coding each article for its research methodology and the authors' stated limitations."
"However, we note that many studies included in this review, even though they were published in peer-reviewed or refereed publications, did not describe the use of a theoretical/conceptual framework and/or did not state limitations of the research."
"To help mitigate this limitation, we employed a second level of critical appraisal by documenting and reflecting on key elements of methodological quality and research design of each included article."
We then developed our recommendations for future research based on this critical appraisal of the included articles.
"Lastly, because the construct of mental health stemmed originally from a medical model of health and illness, the absence of mental illness has been historically considered the state of mental wellbeing or wellness (Greenspoon & Saklofske, 2001)."
"This historical emphasis on mental health as a negative construct (i.e., mental illness) may unknowingly influence researchers to search for sources that focus on these negative views of mental health."
"To mitigate the potential for researcher bias stemming from these human tendencies to possess only partial perspectives and thus give one perspective more weight than another (Gao, 2020b), an engineering education researcher with expertise in MHW and a psychology domain expert was involved in the search string formulation (Borrego et al., 2015)."
"Based on their guidance, we purposefully developed database search strings that included both deficit and anti-deficit keywords to ensure that our search for sources was broadly inclusive of models and constructs associated with MHW."
The following sections report on the findings of this SLR of 34 empirical studies related to the MHW of undergraduate engineering students.
"First, we present an overview of the publication trends of the included research."
"Next, we present answers to the three research questions used to guide the critical appraisal, descriptive characterization, and qualitative results synthesis across included studies."
Findings indicated that most (22/34) of the studies included in the review were published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings rather than archival journals (Figure 2).
"In 2020, there were twice as many conference papers published than journal papers, highlighting the still emerging nature of mental health research in engineering education."
"On searching databases for articles published between 2000 and 2020, we found that the earliest work related to the MHW of engineering undergraduates was published in 2007."
"At about this time, social and behavioral science (SBS) research had started to influence engineering education research (Lohmann & Froyd, 2010)."
"This new and emerging emphasis of SBS research might explain the increasing trend of publications, including both conference proceedings and journal articles, related to MHW in engineering since 2007 (Figure 2)."
"The total number of articles published in 2020 (15) accounts for nearly one-half of those published since 2000 (34), which suggests there is a rapidly increasing base of literature on this topic."
"Our findings further revealed that, while a substantial number of studies (16/34) were conducted within the United States, more than one-half of the studies (18) were conducted within 11 other countries."
"These 18 studies originated within many different parts of the world, including Canada, China, Croatia, India, Italy, the Middle East, Malaysia, North and South America, Southeast Asia, Western Europe, and the United Kingdom (Figure 3)."
This finding suggests that the issues related to MHW in engineering education are recognized internationally and that MHW in engineering education constitutes an area of global research interest.
"As shown in Figure 3, 16 studies were conducted in the United States and 18 studies were conducted in other countries."
"Of the 18 studies conducted outside of the United States, 4 studies were conducted in India, and 3 studies were conducted in China."
Two studies each were published in the United Kingdom and Canada.
"In the rest of the countries (i.e., Thailand, Philippines, Peru, Malaysia, Jordan, Italy, and Croatia), a single study each was published."
"We note that a majority of studies (20/34) originated within predominantly English-speaking countries (i.e., Canada, United Kingdom, United States); this result may have been influenced by the fact that our inclusion criteria required that all studies included in this review be published in English."
"Thus, given the global nature of this literature base, it is possible that studies about MHW in undergraduate engineering education not reported in this SLR could exist and have been published in languages other than English."
A majority of the studies (22/34) were published in peer-reviewed conference proceedings.
"Specifically, eight studies were published in the proceedings of the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) Annual Conference and 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 Number of Publications Publication Year Conference Proceedings Journal Articles Total FIGURE 2 Undergraduate engineering student MHW studies published between 2000 and 2020."

"Most conferences that published studies related to engineering students' MHW are focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts."
"In this section, we answer RQ1 (critical appraisal): What is the state of the research quality of empirical studies related to the MHW of undergraduate students in engineering?"
"During our quality assessment, we observed recurring methodological issues across the included articles."
We identify these issues because they can result in limited or weak generalizability and/or transferability of findings outside of the immediate research context.
"Several methodological issues contributed to this limitation, including small sample sizes for quantitative studies, limited use of random and purposive sampling techniques, limited use of guiding theoretical/conceptual frameworks from social science or psychology, and reliance on descriptive statistics, self-reports, and ad hoc survey instruments for quantitative studies."
"For example, most quantitative studies reported findings based on data collected from participant sample sizes less than 100 without reporting justifications for their sample sizes (i.e., power analysis) or stating their underlying reasons for the sample sizes they attained."
"For example, the lowest number of participants in a single quantitative study was 10 (Coley & Jennings, 2019)."
"Although this small sample size (for a quantitative study) seemed justifiable for this pilot study of Black undergraduate engineering students, the authors did not explicitly state their reasoning."
"Only two studies (Gao, 2020a; Zhang & Luo, 2020) employed random sampling techniques, while 20 studies relied on convenience sampling."
"Out of 23 quantitative and 4 mixed-methods studies, 17 used inferential statistical analysis to develop their findings, while 10 others relied on descriptive statistics."
Both ad hoc and standardized scales were used for quantitative data collection.
"Six studies used ad hoc (non-standardized) scales; ad hoc scales are scales that rely on face validity, are constructed to address a specific need, and/or are applied without much evaluation (Furr, 2011)."
All standardized scales implemented in the included studies originated within the field of psychology.
"Most scales were not validated specifically for engineering students, nor was any statistical fit analysis (e.g., confirmatory factor analysis) performed."
"An exception is Jensen and Cross's (2018) use of the Identification with Academics Subscale, which they adapted for engineering students."
"Researchers often use existing theory (i.e., theoretical frameworks) or multiple constructs from a variety of theories (i.e., conceptual frameworks) to (i) describe how different ideas in their study relate and interact (Ivey, 2015), and (ii) ground the research in accepted foundations of existing scholarship (Merriam & Simpson, 2000)."
Limited connection to established frameworks tends to limit the broader generalizability and/or transferability of findings.
We note that only eight of the included studies made use of either type of framework.
"As shown in Table 2, two studies used theoretical frameworks, while six studies employed conceptual frameworks."
Another issue we noted that affected the research quality of the included articles was the limited acknowledgment and description of author-reported research limitations across the studies.
We noted that only 10/34 studies described the limitations inherent to their work.
"This lack of information related to the contextual and methodological limitations made it difficult to fully assess the extent and potential causes of threats to the research reliability, validity, and trustworthiness that existed within the included studies."
"In this section, we answer RQ2 (scoping): What is the state of research practice of empirical studies related to the mental health and wellbeing of undergraduate students in engineering?"
"To investigate the breadth of potential MHW issues in engineering education, studies in this review employed a variety of approaches (i.e., quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods), research designs (i.e., cross-sectional, experimental, longitudinal, pretest–posttest), and sampling techniques (i.e., random, purposive, convenience)."
"Overall, most studies were quantitative (23/34) and cross-sectional (31/34) in nature; seven (7/34) studies were quasi-experimental."
"Mixed-methods approach was the least used research approach (4/34), longitudinal was the least used research design (3/34), and random sampling was the least used sampling technique (2/34)."
"Few studies reported on participant intersectional identities (e.g., race, ethnicity, non-binary gender)."
"For example, less than one-fourth (8/34) of the studies provided information about the breakdown of their participant sample based on major categories of race/ethnicity (i.e., Asian, Black, Hispanic or Latinx, and White) and only 6 studies provided the participants an option to identify their gender as other than the traditional binary responses."
(Refer to the Appendix for a summary of the data.)
Participant self-reporting through closed- and/or open-ended questionnaires or interviews was the most prominent method used to collect data (28/34 studies).
"In the remaining six studies, researchers employed varied forms of physiological measurements to collect participant data."
"Three studies (Joshi et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2018; Oweis et al., 2018) measured the stress responses of participants in different ways."
Khan et al.
"(2018) collected 1.5 mL saliva samples, Oweis et al."
"(2018) used wearable devices to measure participants' galvanic skin response (GSR), and Joshi et al."
(2016) measured participants' systolic blood pressure.
Three other researchers used alternative approaches to gather data about participants' mental states.
Oner and Kazanasmaz (2020) measured visual discomfort to identify the effects of luminance variations on student mental health.
"To identify signs of mental fatigue among their participants, Chen et al."
"(2017) measured participants' speech patterns, and Zeba et al."
(2019) recorded electroencephalograms (EEGs).
Table 3 summarizes the MHW issues and problems investigated and any potential causes or correlates as identified by the 34 included studies.
"A substantial number of studies (12/34) investigated student mental health generally, without focusing on any particular mental health problem; 2 of these studies investigated general physical health in addition to mental health."
"More than one-half of the studies (19/34) investigated common mental health problems (CMHPs), which include anxiety, depression, stress, panic syndrome, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."
They are mental health problems that produce variations of human emotional distress and often co-occur characterized the co-occurrence of CMHPs among undergraduate engineering students while placing less emphasis on investigating the underlying causes of these issues.
"These studies identified the prevalence of several CMHPs, including anxiety, depression, distress, panic syndrome, PTSD, and worry, among undergraduate engineering students in their research contexts."
"Among all CMHPs, stress was most frequently identified and studied in engineering education contexts; stress was studied in isolation in 12 studies and with other CMHPs (i.e., anxiety and depression) in 1 other study."
"Researchers reported several stress correlates, including imposter syndrome, exam pressure, changes in living conditions due to COVID-19, sleep deprivation, academic workload, and the competitive nature of engineering programs (Schneider, 2007)."
Two studies investigated the occurrence of mental fatigue among undergraduate engineering students caused by general academic activities and exam pressure.
One study investigated Schizophrenia and did not find any significant existence of it in either their male or female participants.
"Schizophrenia is a more severe MHW issue under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V (DSM V) of the American Psychiatric Association (American Psychiatric Association, 2013)."
"In this section, we answer RQ3 (synthesis): What are the major findings of empirical studies related to the mental health and wellbeing of undergraduate students in engineering?"
"Using thematic analysis techniques, we developed three recurrent themes related to the state of MHW of undergraduate students in engineering from the findings of the included studies: (i) Undergraduate students in engineering experience a variety of mental health issues that negatively affect their experiences in engineering education; (ii) The MHW of undergraduate students in engineering is affected by engineering cultural norms; and (iii) The MHW of undergraduate students in engineering may be supported through targeted interventions."
These three themes are further described in the following sections.
"From our synthesis, we conclude that the current condition of MHW of undergraduate engineering is unsatisfactory for supporting academic performance and retention in undergraduate engineering programs."
"The existence of anxiety, depression, panic, stress, and worry appears as a normative occurrence in the undergraduate engineering contexts represented in this review."
"Studies also reported that, when compared to the general public, participants were twice as likely to exhibit anxiety, depression, or PTSD, and several times more likely to display signs of panic syndrome and psychological distress."
"Among the many MHW issues reported across studies, stress was the issue most frequently investigated and reported on."
"Our results indicate that stress in undergraduate engineering education is pervasive, status quo, and chronic."
Most studies investigated and characterized stress in undergraduate engineering education and did not experimentally determine the causes of this stress.
"Of the studies that did report on potential causes of stress in engineering education, the heavy academic workload was the most frequent stress correlate reported."
"More broadly, reported levels of other MHW issues experienced by undergraduate engineering students were not consistent and ranged from moderate to clinically diagnosable levels."
"The existence of moderate to severe depression among engineering undergraduate students was reported in two studies (Goodwin, 2020; Jensen & Cross, 2018)."

"21689830, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20574 by National Institutes Of Health Malaysia, Wiley Online Library on [26/09/2024]."
"See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License reported severe or extremely severe levels of anxiety, depression, and stress among some of their participants."
"Examined the MHW of Black engineering undergraduates, reported the existence of severe depression, severe anxiety, and high levels of worry such that all issues approached clinically diagnosable levels."
Clinically diagnosable levels of mental health conditions were also reported by 28.4% of participants in the study.
"Our analyses further revealed that most studies did not report or make explicit distinctions/comparisons between the outcomes for students from underrepresented groups in engineering, including women and students from racially or ethnically minoritized groups in engineering."
"Therefore, comparisons between the condition of the MHW of engineering undergraduate students who identify as women or as being from minoritized groups in engineering cannot be determined from this review."
"However, studies (4/34) that did make these types of distinctions reported that women and students from minoritized groups in engineering experience overall poorer MHW compared to their counterparts from dominant groups (i.e., White male students)."
Results of our synthesis suggest that engineering undergraduate students often perceive the engineering education environment and its cultural norms to be major sources of stress.
"For example, students consider “all-nighters” to be a “rite of passage” in becoming an engineer."
"Students accept poor mental health as normal and even necessary, expressing views such as “the engineering student life is stressful and sometimes detrimental to mental health”."
"Consequently, the ongoing identity formation of undergraduate students as engineers may be inappropriately influenced by their understanding of engineering as an academically and psychologically tough field where mental health is supposed to be poor by default."
"In this environment, seeking help for MHW issues can be perceived by engineering undergraduates as a threat to their self-esteem and their identification as an engineer, rather than as an opportunity to improve their daily life."
"Within engineering disciplines, programmatic cultures are also perceived and identified as being good or bad for engineering students' MHW."
"For example, computer engineering students (CPE) were not satisfied with the nature of their program and perceived electrical engineering students to have a superior quality of MHW."
The lack of satisfaction with the nature of the program existed because “many students appear to view CPE as more of an experience in double-majoring (in electrical and computer science) than a separate degree program” reported conflicting results and reported electrical engineering students having the lowest state of MHW when compared to students from other engineering departments.
"In another study, common mental health problems were reported to be negatively correlated with department inclusion efforts on a significant level."
"Further, depression and acceptance of an engineering stress culture were reported to be detrimental to help-seeking behavior."
"To support students to develop engineering identities that are not overwhelmingly influenced by academic and psychological struggles, emphasized making improvements in the quality of teaching, counseling, and extracurricular activities, and in creating an overall positive collegiate environment."
"As one example of this strategy,  described their implementation of a summer bridge program to support future academic success and cultivate positive mental health among incoming engineering students."
"The program, which focused on helping students develop “culturally affirming” engineering identities by enabling them to begin their engineering studies equipped with academic and MHW coping skills, received high approval from participating students."
"Across the included studies, several researchers (10/34) reported on the implementation of targeted interventions that led to improvements in the condition of MHW of their participants."
"To a large extent, researchers used wellbeing interventions in conjunction with existing undergraduate engineering academic activities."
"In the following sections, we discuss the findings of this SLR and the implications of these findings for future research and practice in this area."
"Overall, we offer a critique of the existing research related to MHW in three areas: (i) the lack of explicit connection of the research design and findings to explanatory or organizing theoretical/conceptual frameworks, (ii) an over-reliance on cross-sectional and other single-engagement research designs that may not treat participants with adequate levels of care or provide for the in-depth understandings of intersectional experiences of MHW, and (iii) predominant reuse of existing scales instead of developing new or adapting existing scales specifically for the context of engineering education."
"Historically, theoretical/conceptual frameworks have been underutilized by engineering education researchers."
"Generally, our review indicated that the current research related to MHW in engineering lacks an explicit connection to theory."
"While less than one-quarter (8/34) of the studies in this review employed a theoretical/conceptual framework, increasing use of frameworks over time was noted: seven of eight studies that employed frameworks were published in/after 2018."
This trend of increasing use of frameworks over time may point to a growing level of sophistication in research design as research in this area continues to mature.
"Abstract:A person is considered to be healthy if they are mentally sharp, physically fit, and socially balanced."
"Any modification of the physical, emotional, or social components may cause discomfort or sickness."
The disease that results from a disruption in the equilibrium of all three aspects of health may also be used to describe it.
"The term ""mental health"" refers to the social and emotional wellbeing of individuals as well as groups."
"The idea has to do with having fun in life, being able to handle stress and sadness, realising one's potential and achieving goals, and having a sense of community."
Students need to take good care of their mental health.
The idea has grown significantly in the current situation.
The need to safeguard students' mental health is discussed in this study.
"In-depth discussion is also given to the functions of society, schools, and families."
"As a part of health, mental health is essential."
"Psychological, emotional, and social wellbeing are all parts of one's mental health."
"A person's ability to be productive in their activities, to have rewarding relationships with others, and to handle and overcome adversity all depend on having good mental health."
"Every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence to maturity, requires good mental health."
"Any moment during their lifespan, a person may have mental health problems."
"This alters their perspective on life, obstacles, and how they approach them, as well as their attitude and behaviour."
"Despite the fact that mental health is so individual and that what affects one person may or may not affect another, there are several important elements that lead to mental health issues."
"These variables include life events like trauma or abuse, biological variables like DNA or brain chemistry, and even a person's family history of mental health issues can have an impact."
"Stressful work environments, quick societal change, gender discrimination, social isolation, physical disease, and violations of human rights are all associated with poor mental health."
"Although mental health issues are widespread, for the longest time, people avoided the subject altogether and assumed everyone had mental health."
"Mental illness was once stigmatized, and everyone who sought care was dismissed as having a mental illness."
Mental well-being and mental disease are not the same.
Mental health has long been regarded as the absence of disorders like anxiety and sadness.
"Generally speaking, the term ""mental illness"" refers to all diagnosable mental diseases, which are illnesses characterized by changes in mood, thought, and behaviour that are connected to diminished functioning or discomfort."
"Together, mental wellness and mental illness are interrelated."
"Those with the best mental health can nonetheless experience mental illness, while persons without mental disease can still have poor mental health."
People have recently begun to take mental health seriously and to deal with any concerns with mental health in a responsible manner.
Those with mental health issues can improve by seeking out the treatment that is offered there.
"People with mental health problems exhibit a variety of symptoms, including low energy, withdrawing from others and from daily activities, losing interest in eating or sleeping, smoking, drinking, or using drugs, feeling hopeless, yelling and fighting, losing their temper easily, harming themselves, and more."
"In addition to seeking professional assistance when necessary, maintaining good mental health involves maintaining relationships with people, participating in physical activity, lending a helpful hand, getting enough sleep, and believing that there is a solution."
"Those who are in good mental health are able to reach their full potential, deal effectively with life's stresses, work well, and give back to their communities."
"Several aspects of a person's life, including physical aspects, childhood trauma, intrapersonal relationships, and many other situations, might interfere with their mental health."
A person's capacity to appreciate life is preserved when they take care of and look after their mental health.
"The term ""mental health"" refers to a person's overall wellbeing, which includes their psychological, emotional, and cognitive well-being as well as their ability to meet the demands of daily life and contribute to society."
"From childhood to adolescence to adulthood, one's mental health is crucial at every stage of life."
The 10th of October is recognised as World Mental Health Day each year.
"By the then-deputy secretarygeneral of the UNO (United Nations Organization), it was established as an annual activity by the world federation for mental health."
Each nation has a unique set of resources for mental health.
"At the same time, affluent nations in the west offer mental health services for all age groups."
"In developing nations where it can be difficult for families to meet their basic requirements, adequate mental health care is not given much priority."
"Mental Health of Students: -A state of emotional, cognitive, and behavioural wellbeing is referred to as mental health."
It all comes down to a person's mental process and how it influences their feelings and actions.
"It's common to use the term ""mental health"" to denote the absence of a mental disease."
Mental health is equally as crucial as physical health.
"Sadly, it doesn't receive the attention that it needs."
"The effects of this neglect on human rights, social, economic, and health issues are significant."
"Even while everyone can develop psychiatric disorders, college students are among the most susceptible populations."
Adolescent years mark a crucial time in the passage from childhood to maturity.
"Changes in the brain, body, and social environment are a result of adolescence."
"They become more susceptible to numerous psychiatric disorders as a result.Their mental health is impacted by a number of factors, including heredity, parental attachment styles, the demands and frustrations of school and college, low self-esteem, physical changes, interpersonal conflicts, living in a dangerous or toxic environment, parental separation or divorce, chronic illness in the family, loved one deaths, moving or changing schools, money woes, internet addiction, etc."
"Commonly documented problems with adolescent onset include major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders such anorexia and bulimia, and substance usage."
"Surprisingly, suicide ranks as the third most common cause of mortality for young adults and is a serious issue among college students."
"Due to stigma or a lack of knowledge, mental diseases on the Indian subcontinent go undetected and people are less likely to seek care."
"According to a poll by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 12–13% of Indian students experience emotional, behavioural, and/or psychological problems."
The move to entering a college is one of the most exciting and occasionally stressful ones.
Colleges give students access to academic information and serve as their second homes.
They grow emotionally attached to the educational institutions over time.
"Together with exciting new experiences, college life also presents numerous difficulties."
"After entering college, a person's life undergoes a number of adjustments."
Education adds unneeded stress rather than enhancing life skills.
Concern should be expressed over the growing gap between what education is and what it should be.
This could set off a mental illness or worsen its symptoms already present.
It is impossible to disregard the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic while talking about mental health.
The pandemic contributed to an increase in adult mental illnesses.
"Day-to-day activities, education, routines, leisure activities, and concerns for family finances and health were disrupted by the pandemic."
"Many young people were scared, upset, and apprehensive about the future as a result."
Fear and uncertainty brought on by the pandemic impacted mental health.
Pupils had a hard time adjusting to the digital classrooms that were taking over as everything moved online.
Low socioeconomic status students were particularly heavily harmed since they lacked access to laptops and other amenities.
"Students claimed that because the majority of them were struggling with anxiety, loneliness, sadness, and fear, they could not enjoy academic activities."
"Not only was there a dread of poor performance and failing to meet academic objectives, but there was also a fear of the future."
The anxiety and sadness levels of the students considerably rose whenever a family member developed Covid-19.
"Due to lockdown precautions, children have only had a restricted amount of access to social services throughout the pandemic."
"Isolation and anxiety were brought on by being away from friends, family, classes, and recreational activities."
"Several individuals remained in unhealthy living conditions, which increased their risk of maltreatment and neglect.They will continue to experience the effects of Covid-19 on their mental health and wellbeing for many years to come."
"In certain circumstances, stigma among college students is brought on by ignorance, denial of mental health symptoms, poor or insufficient treatment, and it makes mental health issues more persistent in this demographic."
"Just 41% of young people in India seek treatment for mental health issues, compared to an average of 83 percent for the 21 nations surveyed by UNICEF in a study on help-seeking behaviour."
"These figures are alarming.The trajectory and prognosis of the disorder will be positively impacted by identifying protective factors, early identification, and treatment of psychiatric problems."
"Loving caretakers secure surroundings at home, at school, and in college, as well as healthy peer connections, are some of the protective factors that can reduce the impact of stress."
"As was already mentioned, stigma and inadequate funding of mental health services prevent people from having a positive mental health or from getting the assistance they require."
"In order for instructors to support children, it is critical to educate them on psychological problems, as well as the relevant interventions."
Courses on basic mental health issue recognition and psychological first aid can support the achievement of this goal.
College clubs can also hold talks and campaigns on mental health.
Colleges and universities ought to have health facilities.
Identification of issues will be aided by a cooperative interaction between medical facilities and behavioural health providers.
"Subsequently, if necessary, referrals to behavioural health facilities can be made."
Electronic medical records can be used to coordinate services (EMRs).
EMRs may be a wise choice for college students since they improve provider coordination and communication.
"In order to meet the requirements of students from LGBTQ+ populations, a safe atmosphere needs to be established."
The young minds will take care of the nation.
It is crucial to concentrate on their growth and welfare.
"Without psychological empowerment, there can be no empowerment."
"They will develop into sensible, emotionally secure, healthy, and productive adults if given the right support in all facets of life, including mental health."
Objective of the Study: -To study the mental health needs of students in the present modern context and the role played by various factors in maintaining the mental health of students.
Significance of the study: -Mental health is a necessary and comprehensive subject of study.
Its scope relates to the entire life of man.
Mental health issues are about the nature and problems of a person's relationship with the outside world.
"The concept of mental health involves all aspects of a person's life, from childhood to every stage of development and their characteristics, a person's family or home, his school, relatives, friends, neighbours, leisure preparation, etc."
A person's mental health in his future life depends on his childhood experiences.
Healthy mental health of people of all ages and levels of society is essential for the holistic development of a society.
The home or family takes the primary responsibility for maintaining healthy mental health as a person receives the family or home environment from birth.
Child rearing practices in the home environment contribute significantly to mental health.
"In addition, various personality factors and personality development characteristics also determine mental health."
"Apart from the home environment, school is another medium that affects mental health."
Children's mental health can also be developed in the school environment.
Methodology: - Analytical methods have been used for this study.
"Data are collected from secondary sources like books, magazines, journals internet etc."
"Need and importance of Mental Health: -The goal of mental health is the development of a healthy, balanced and integrated personality."
"Through mental health, individuals can realize their self-being, live satisfactorily and happily and achieve their goals in life with the aim of contributing to society."
" Helps in the development of desirable personality:-Mental health helps in developing a healthy, balanced and integrated personality."
"This type of development can maintain a proper balance between one's own and environmental circumstances, one's own needs with the needs of society, and can exemplify an integrated personality rather than a fragmented person."
 Helps in Proper Emotional Development:-There is a close relationship between a person's mental health and emotional behaviour.
People who enjoy healthy mental health show emotional maturity in their behaviour.
 Help in Proper social Development:-A person's mental health helps the person to establish appropriate social relationships in society.
People who have no conflict with their self-being have enough time and energy to establish relationships with others.
It helps in a person's social behaviour and proper social adjustment.
 Helpin Proper moral Development:-People who enjoy healthy mental health usually follow the moral standards of society and behave as honest and characterful people.
Their proper intellectual functioning keeps them away from immoral and anti-social behaviour.
"Helps in Proper aesthetic development:-Proper mental health helps in the development of proper aesthetic sense, artistic taste and refined mood."
"A mind free from any excitement, conflict, frustration, inferiority, guilt or adverse attitudes can flow towards aesthetic, artistic and creative development instead of complexity or conflict."
 Helps in actualizing one’s potentialities:-Mental health is essential for a person to realize his or her own potential.
"If children are in good mental health, they can try better to realize their potential."
"In contrast, children without healthy mental health cannot realize their potential due to intellectual disabilities, isolated personalities and inappropriate behaviour."
 Helps in seeking proper adjustment:-A mentally healthy person is a well-adjusted person.
Such persons are able to adapt appropriately to themselves and their environment.
They are able to adapt to the circumstances of society and the needs of health.
 Helps in seeking Goals of Life:-Mental health helps a person to strive to achieve the goals of life properly.
Holistic mental health always empowers a person to achieve this goal with full strength.
 Helps in Progress of the society:-Mental health helps to develop a person into a balanced and important citizen who is aware of his rights as well as his responsibilities.
Individuals receive the needs from society for their proper development and living and are also willing to give something for the progress and development of society.
" Helpsin the prevention of mental illness:-Mental health helps protect individuals from behavioural abnormalities, maladjustments and mental illness."
"Compared to impaired mental health, a healthy mind and balanced personality provides sufficient resistance to fight against life's adversities and to cope with accidents and life's stresses."
"Mental health and mental hygiene: -The adage ""health is riches"" is true."
Health is supposedly the most valuable possession a person may have in the world.
Having money is undoubtedly a great thing.
"A healthy guy in ruins, however, he cannot make happy."
"As the body and mind are intertwined, neither can be strong and fun without the other."
"Self-neglect, or the inability or reluctance to tend to one's personal needs, can be indicated by poor hygiene."
"Some mental or emotional disorders, such as severe depression and psychotic disorders may go hand in hand with poor hygiene."
"One of the first indications that someone has a mental illness is poor personal hygiene, which includes forgetting to wash, use deodorant, change clothes, and brush one's teeth on a regular basis."
"This decline may be caused by the illness's disorganization, general indifference, or lack of motivation."
One of the most important aspects of our daily lives is practicing proper hygiene.
Many residents of remote areas might not know the difference between excellent and bad hygiene.
"By practicing good personal cleanliness, it is very likely that communicable diseases like trachoma and diarrheal would be avoided."
"In order to prevent and control serious public health issues that are common in our area, we must understand the correct hygiene practices."
"The term ""hygiene"" refers to healthy behaviours that promote illness prevention and good health, particularly cleanliness, correct wastewater disposal, and access to clean water."
It describes all the things that are done to maintain and improve one's health.
Any human being's life has a vital and crucial component called mental hygiene.
The fact that practically every religion on earth has promoted hygiene helps us understand how important it is.
The advantages of hygiene extend beyond the physical makeup of people; it also affects some psychological behaviours.
"It increases self-esteem, morale, and selfconfidence in a person."
A person's level of hygiene reflects their style of living.
A person who practices effective self-care is able to feel at ease in their own skin as well as in the comfort of those around them.
A person with high moral standards would never neglect their mental hygiene.
"Similar to how maintaining physical fitness keeps our bodies strong, maintaining mental fitness enables us to achieve and maintain good mental health."
"When our minds are in good shape, we appreciate our lives, our surroundings, and the people that inhabit them."
"We have the ability to learn, experiment, and take risks."
"In both our personal and professional lives, we are better equipped to handle challenging situations."
"We experience the grief and rage that sometimes accompany death, but we are then able to go on and resume enjoying our lives."
The mental health issues that are occasionally linked to a chronic physical condition can be fought or prevented by taking care of our mental health.
"In rare instances, it can stop a medical or mental condition from developing or relapsing."
"For example, good stress management can reduce the risk of heart disease."
"One in five people will develop a mental disease in their lifetime, and people battle mental health issues every day."
Innovations that would improve the public mental health plan should be carefully considered.
A sort of preventive maintenance called mental hygiene is connected to the practices of physical cleanliness.
Mental training exercises can promote wholesome cognitive processes that are beneficial to wellbeing thanks to the plasticity of the brain.
A few daily mental hygiene activities that one can do to promote wellbeing and help prevent mental health problems.
"Such mental training behaviours may be used to lessen common human tendencies to ruminate and mind wander unconsciously, which when excessively present are linked to increased activity of the default mode network, susceptibility to the pathogenesis of mental illness, as well as impending human flourishing."
Achieving and maintaining mental health in society are topics covered by the science of mental hygiene.
"The terms ""mental hygiene"" and ""mental health"" are closely related since the primary goal of mental hygiene is a systematic body of knowledge that seeks to achieve mental health."
The absence of mental illness is only one aspect of good mental health.
"We can learn, think, engage, produce, overcome challenges, and present our best selves when we are in good mental health."
"When we feel good about ourselves and are able to handle the pressures of daily life, we are said to be in good mental health."
The technique of attempting to preserve mental health through an adjustment mechanism is known as mental health hygiene.
Good mental hygiene habits can support us in coping with psychological trauma.
"Being a branch of the science of healthy living, mental hygiene enables us to investigate all the key problems pertaining to the pursuit of tranquillity."
Role of Family: -Family is the foundation of home.
A family is a unit that may or may not be linked.
"""A group consisting of parents and children living together in a household"" is the definition of family."
Children may also be impacted by parents or guardians who are struggling with their own mental health.
"First and foremost, a parent's perception of and behaviour towards their child sets the stage for that youngster's healthy mental health."
"Children's top priority, especially in early to middle childhood, is to win the approval of their adult caretakers."
The ability to overcome possible temptations that lead adolescents to make decisions that put their mental health at risk will be facilitated by the acceptance and affection that are fostered in the home from birth.
Open communication and learning how to speak to kids might be helpful in this area.
Students' good mental health is maintained in large part by their parents and guardians at home.
"To achieve these goals, the following steps should be taken:"
"Foster a sense of belonging: Children's positive adjustment, self-identification, and sense of trust in others and themselves all depend on them feeling connected and welcomed."
"Promoting mental wellness requires parents and children to have solid, wholesome relationships."
"• Foster resilience: Overcoming obstacles and maintaining good mental health require being resilient, which is a quality that comes naturally with life."
"Resilience can be fostered at home through connectedness, competence, assisting others, and successfully navigating challenging circumstances."
• Maintain a positive atmosphere: Students' learning and mental health depend on feeling safe.
"Positive behaviours like kindness, respect, and accountability should be encouraged by parents and family members."
• Encourage giving to others:Young people must understand their power to influence others.
"Family members should promote self-worth, connection, uphold individual accountability, and provide chances for positive reinforcement."
• Promote physical health: Good mental health is supported by good physical health.
"Children should have access to a good diet, frequent exercise, and enough sleep at home to help them cope with stressful situations."
"Frequent exercise and meditation should be promoted at home to reduce negative emotions like anger, despair, and anxiety."
Role of School: -The school is the most significant agency that affects a child's development.
The child gains information in a variety of subjects at school to help him get ready for life after school.
A resourceful and supportive teacher gets the most out of the students and helps them build their confidence.
The school supports the child's development of a scientific outlook on life and helps him become familiar with the physical and social world.
The students gain most from a school where there is a high level of concern for the child and interest in his welfare.
"Hence, rather than buildings or books, what matters in a school for good personality development is the human element offered by the teachers and the school.It has been discovered that a child makes improvement in social skills by learning from classmates and other pupils within the first year of entering pre-primary school."
"So, it is ideal that the school meet the child's typical psychological demands."
"To avoid being viewed as a terrifying force but rather as a friend and a mentor, the teacher should cultivate a positive and harmonious relationship with his pupils."
"The instructor should be approachable and helpful, and students should feel comfortable to talk to him about any issues they are having."
Overly competitive feelings should be avoided because they are bad for both the individual and the community.
"The teachers that were least liked by their students were those who were unhelpful, unfair, unreasonable, caustic, partial, and annoying."
Children's mental health is also impacted by the teacher's methods of discipline and punishment.
However evidence from both experience and observation indicates that severe punishment harms children's mental health.
"In order to motivate his students to learn, the teacher should employ rewards of all types rather than punishments from a mental health perspective."
"Role of society:-In addition to the home and school, society is represented by a variety of institutions/components, such as the neighbourhood, social groups, religious organizations, modes of transportation, media outlets, and forms of amusement."
Play a significant part in preserving mental wellness.
Social support and excellent mental health have many advantages.
"Lower rates of anxiety and depression, more self-esteem, greater empathy, and more dependable and cooperative relationships are just a few examples of linkages that have been proven."
"Our immune system can be strengthened by strong, healthy relationships, and these connections can also aid in our recovery from illness and possibly even extend our lives.Humans are social creatures."
A web of social ties makes up society.
"An individual's social surroundings, as well as the social connections they form therein, can also have a profound impact on physical and mental health and future achievements."
A sizable body of research supports the idea that a person's social environment affects their mental health.
• Physical environment: A person's physical environment has a significant impact on their health.
Poor physical conditions are related with unfavourable health outcomes in environments.
"Affordable, high-quality housing is related with less poverty and more home stability, both of which have an impact on children's health and the social bonds they develop."
• Educational facilities: It's also critical to have access to high-quality educational facilities within a community.
Individuals living in socioeconomically marginalized communities are less likely to attend and reap the benefits of early childhood education.
Attending early childhood education is linked to improved child development.
"Children who do not participate in early childhood education have also been demonstrated to be significantly more at risk of receiving abusive treatment as youngsters, which poses a risk to their mental health."
• Community rules and norms: Community rules and norms can also have an impact on children's mental health.
• Social connections: A high quality of life and mental health depend on establishing and maintaining strong social connections.
"People with healthy connections experience a sense of community and receive support from others in their social network, which enables them to go about their daily lives regularly and deal with stress and challenging situations."
• Motivation: People who live in environments where there are healthy social connections are more motivated than people who do not.
"It has been discovered that peer support is a significant predictor of a child's motivation to pursue social goals, whereas teacher support boosts a child's willingness to pursue both social and academic goals."
The amount of school interest and goal-setting of youngsters are both influenced by their parents' support.
"Conclusion: -A person's ability to employ their cognitive and emotional capacities is a sign of mental health, which is a condition of emotional and psychological well-being."
"It impacts our thoughts, feelings, and actions."
"It also affects how we respond to stress, interact with others, and make decisions."
Mental health includes the capacity to deal with life's obstacles as well as the absence of mental illness.
It means preserving a suitable level of personality development and a general lack of mental illness.
"A person who is mentally well leads a fuller, happier, peaceful, and productive existence."
He is well-adjusted and capable of changing with the times.
"At every stage of life, including childhood and adolescence, mental health is crucial.Positive ideas about people's and communities' social and emotional well-being are associated with the concept of mental health."
"The idea has to do with having fun in life, being able to handle stress and sadness, realising one's potential and achieving goals, and having a sense of community."
"Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community."
India's mental health struggles are largely due to societal stigma and inadequate healthcare access.
Depression is a major cause of disability worldwide and contributes greatly to the global disease burden.
"Depression is characterized by persistent sadness, hopelessness, irritability, guilt, loss of interest, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, physical aches, and thoughts of death or suicide."
"Symptoms can also include increased anger, restlessness, withdrawal, impulsivity, alcohol or drug use, isolation, and difficulties with sexual desire and performance."
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common types of depression.
"It is characterized by changes in neuronal structure and function, which are accompanied by several biochemical changes."
"It is caused by a variety of biological, psychological, and environmental factors."
"This review will cover depression, its signs and symptoms, risk factors, mechanisms, and management."
"The management of depression includes various types of medication, therapies, counselling, stimulation, and strategies to combat depression."
"Mental health is a condition of mental well-being that allows people to cope with life's stressful events, realize their strengths, study and work effectively, and add value to their society."
Mental health encompasses more than just the absence of mental diseases.
"Mental illnesses and psychosocial disabilities, as well as other mental states linked with considerable suffering, disability in functioning, or risk of self-harm, are examples of mental health issues."
"A clinically significant impairment in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behavior characterizes a mental disorder."
It is often associated with anxiety or problems in vital areas of functioning.
"In 2019, one in every eight individuals, or 970 million people worldwide, suffered from a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression being the most frequent."
"Because of the covid-19 epidemic, the number of persons living with anxiety and depression illnesses increased dramatically in 2020."
There are two main reasons for increasing mental health disorders in India.
"First of all, India's mental health struggles are largely due to societal stigma and limited healthcare access."
"People often view mental health issues as taboo, leading to isolation and shame."
"As societies transition to nuclear families, stress and social isolation have increased, causing an increase in mental health issues."
The second most important reason for the country's poor mental health is a lack of mental health specialists.
"There are various mental disorders like Anxiety disorders, Depression, Bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, Schizophrenia, Disruptive behaviour and dissocial disorders, Neurodevelopmental disorders, eating disorders etc."
Depression and anxiety are two of the most frequent mental health problems.
"This review will cover depression, its signs and symptoms, risk factors, mechanisms, and management."
1.1 Two main reasons for poor mental health in India 1.1.1 Lack of awareness in society India's mental health issues are largely due to societal stigma and inadequate healthcare infrastructure.
"The country's nuclear families have increased stress and anxiety levels, leading to an increase in mental health problems."
"Governments and social institutes need to educate about mental health issues and remove misconceptions, as they have successfully addressed diseases like polio, leprosy, and typhoid."
"This will help reduce the cycle of shame, suffering, and isolation experienced by those suffering from mental health issues."
"1.1.2 Shortage of mental health professional The Indian Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare reports that the country needs around 13,000 psychiatrists, but currently has only 3500, which is one psychiatrist for over 2 lakh people."
"Other mental health professionals, such as clinical psychologists, social workers, and nurses, also face shortages."
"Many psychiatrists leave India for better opportunities abroad due to limited awareness and stigma associated with mental illness, making it difficult for them to match other medical specialties in terms of income and recognition."
Depression (Depressive disorder) Depression is a very frequent mental illness.
It is distinguished by continuous unhappiness and a loss of interest or pleasure in formerly rewarding or pleasurable activities.
It can also impact with appetite and restful sleep.
Tiredness and lack of attention are common symptoms.
"Depression's consequences can be long-lasting or recurring, and they can have a significant impact on a person's capacity to function and live a fulfilling life."
It is believed that 5% of adults worldwide suffer from the illness.
"Depression is one of the biggest causes of disability worldwide, contributing significantly to the global illness burden."
"Depression is caused by complex interplay between social, psychological, and biological variables."
"Childhood hardship, loss, and unemployment all contribute to and may hasten the onset of depression."
"Depression and related mental diseases can have a significant impact on all parts of life, including academic achievement, work productivity, relationships with family and friends, and ability to participate in community activities."
"There are also strong links between depression and physical health, such as TB and cardiovascular disease, according to research."
"Depression affects people of all ages, affluent and poor, and in all countries."
Women are more prone than men to suffer from depression.
"Statistics on Global and Indian Mental Health: The Effects of Depression on Population and Mortality Globally, the total number of people suffering from depression was predicted to exceed 300 million in 2015, accounting for 4.3% of the worldwide population."
"According to the national mental health survey 2015-16, over 15% of Indian adults require active intervention for one or more mental health conditions, and one in every twenty Indians suffers from depression."
"It is projected that over 258 000 suicides occurred in India in 2012, with the age group 15-49 years being the most afflicted."
Depression is the most prevalent cause of global disability (7.5% of all years lived with disability in 2015).
"At its worst, depression can lead to suicide; each year, over 800,000 people commit suicide."
It is the second biggest cause of death among people aged 15 to 29.
"Signs And Symptoms of Depression If you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms, most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks, you may be suffering from depression: • Persistent sad, anxious, or “empty” mood • Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism • Feelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessness • Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness • Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities • Decreased energy, fatigue, or feeling slowed down • Difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions • Difficulty sleeping, waking early in the morning, or oversleeping • Changes in appetite or unplanned weight changes • Physical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause and do not go away with treatment • Thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempts"
Not every person who is depressed exhibits all of these symptoms.
"Some people have only a few symptoms, while others have several symptoms."
Depression symptoms interfere with daily functioning and cause severe distress for the person experiencing them.
"Other changes in mood or behavior that can accompany depression include: • Increased frustration or irritation • Feeling anxious or on edge • being withdrawn, negative, or detached • Increased participation in high-risk activities • Higher impulsivity • Rise in use of alcohol or drugs Exclusion from family and friends • Inability to fulfill work and family responsibilities or ignoring other significant duties • Issues with sexual desire and performance Men and women handle depression in different ways."
"Although men, women, and people of all genders can experience depression, how they exhibit those symptoms and the coping methods they employ may differ."
"Some men (and women) may exhibit symptoms other than melancholy, such as being angry or irritated."
"And, while increasing use of alcohol or drugs can be a coping mechanism for anybody suffering from depression, men may be more likely to do so."
"Risk Factors for Depression Depression is a prevalent mental disorder influenced by genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors."
"It can occur at any age, but typically begins in adulthood."
"It is also present in children and adolescents, with children often expressing more irritability than sadness."
Chronic mood and anxiety disorders in adults often begin with high levels of anxiety in childhood.
"Depression can co-occur with other serious medical illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease, making these conditions worse."
"The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has acknowledged that certain mental disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19."
"Physical health problems or medications can also contribute to depression, and a healthcare provider experienced in treating these complex illnesses can help develop the best treatment strategy."
"Other risk factors for depression include: • Personal or family history of depression • Major negative life changes, trauma, or stress • biological (genetic, chronic diseases, terminal illness) • Psychological • Social (familial, relationships, violence, disasters) • Cultural (religion, caste, beliefs, attitudes) • Economic • Consumption of alcohol and drugs can further aggravate the condition."
"Types of Depression (Depressive disorder) There are many different types of depression, some of which are caused by events in your life, and others by chemical changes in the brain."
"Mechanism of depression There are five different theories of pathophysiology of depression: The Monoamine Hypothesis The monoamine hypothesis, developed in the 1960s and 1970s, suggests that depression is caused by dysfunction in adrenergic or serotonergic neurotransmission."
Two observations based on this theory include the depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain by antihypertensive drug reserpine and the modification of norepinephrine and serotonin levels by antidepressant drugs.
"Iproniazid, an antimycobacterial agent, improved mood in tubercular patients with depression and was found to inhibit monoamine oxidase, preventing the degradation of serotonin and norepinephrine."
Later studies showed that cerebral spinal fluid levels of monoamines and their metabolites were different in patients with depression compared to individuals without depression.
"The monoamine hypothesis proposes that there is a depletion in the level of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine in the central nervous system, which is more important for neuropsychopharmacologists than major or minor neurotransmitter systems."
"Neuro Endocrine Hypothesis The neuro-endocrine hypothesis suggests that depressive disorders are caused by dysregulation of the endocrine system, with at least three subsystems playing important roles in the pathogenesis."
The thyroid gland and endocrine gonads are two subsystems that are known to function improperly in mood disturbances.
"Cortisol plays a multifaceted role in mood disorders, with patients being resistant to the feedback action of exogenous glucocorticoids and having elevated basal cortisol levels."
"Impaired corticosteroid receptor function may be the key mechanism in the pathogenesis of depression, leading to dysfunctional stress hormone regulation."
Studies have shown that abnormal functions can be detected at the level of the hypothalamus in depression.
"Corticotrophin-releasing hormone is secreted from hypothalamic paraventricular cells, stimulating the pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone, which stimulates the cortex of the suprarenal glands to secrete cortisol into the general circulation."
"However, elevated cortisol levels do not correct the levels of corticotrophin-releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone."
Cortisol is an important component of the complex emotional response initiated and controlled by the hypothalamus and is an intracerebral neurotransmitter and/or neuromodulator.
"It is secreted from the adrenal glands in hourly pulses and can penetrate the brain, having multiple effects depending on the concentration."
"High cortisol levels facilitate the emotional response and inhibit the cognitive response to stress, while also protecting central nervous system nerve cells against potential damage due to uncontrolled, heavy activity."
Neuro-Immune Hypothesis Depression is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by changes in neuronal structure and function.
The neuroimmune hypothesis for the genesis of depression focuses on the inhibition of hippocampal function.
"Neurotrophic factors are produced by a variety of immune cells and have pleiotropic effects (multiple actions and multiple targets), including important effects in the central nervous system (CNS)."
"These cytokines are produced in the periphery by different immune cells, including activated monocytes, macrophages, T cells, B-cells, natural killer cells, and fibroblasts, in response to different stimuli, including pathogen-associated molecules, danger signals, and stress."
These proinflammatory factors are primarily produced by immune-competent cells and are involved in the elaboration of the central component of the acute phase inflammatory response.
"In the central nervous system, inflammatory factors have a significant impact on brain development and neuroplasticity, including the emergence of structural changes that can be considered neurodegenerative, and this condition may progress into Alzheimer's disease and other dementias."
"Thus, antidepressant drugs may protect neurons from detrimental changes by promoting repair and construction or reconstruction of neural networks."
"The Kindling (Neurogenesis/Neuroplasticity) Hypothesis The amygdala-kindling model is used to investigate the emergence of clinical seizure disorders (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy) as well as the emergence of behavioral disorders (especially bipolar mood disorders)."
"According to the kindling hypothesis, a similar trend occurs in depressive illnesses, where first episodes are triggered by psychosocial stresses, but after enough repetition, they also begin to develop spontaneously."
"The endocrine system is expected to play a major role in the emergence of kindling seizures, which are accompanied by a number of biochemical alterations including classical neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, cytokines, and neurotrophic factors."
"Furthermore, the hippocampus/amygdala complex is thought to have a role in the pathophysiology of depression."
"In this review, we provide a possible explanation for the pathogenicity of depression, which may be mainly related to its anti-manic activity, and its anti-depressive effects may occur elsewhere."
"The Biorhythm Hypothesis Depression is a condition characterized by a malfunction in the biological clock, leading to sleep disturbances, disrupted sleep architecture, and irregular biorhythms."
"Symptoms can fluctuate over the day, with some experiencing seasonal patterns."
Psychiatric hypnograms show irregular sleep phases and abnormal sleep sequences.
"The endogenous biological clock is regulated by genes, including the circadian pacemaker in the brain."
"The biological clock of the suprachiasmaticus requires daily entrainment signals, called ""Zeitgebers,"" triggered by daylight and melatonin."
"The interaction between daylight, melatonin, and the circadian rhythm is complex, but a simplified model suggests that the biological clock is reset by full exposure to daylight."
"Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland during sleep, enhances sensitivity to daylight entrainment, affecting the biorhythms of patients with dysfunctional retinas."
The biorhythm hypothesis postulates that depressive symptoms are caused by a dysfunction in the spinal cord that affects the generation of a correct circadian rhythm.
Management of Depression Even the most severe symptoms of depression are treatable.
Treatment is more successful the earlier it is started.
"Psychotherapy, stimulation therapy, medicine, and counseling are the usual treatments for depression."
"Medication for Depression Prescription drugs known as antidepressants are often used to treat anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression."
Antidepressants are medications that improve depression symptoms by boosting mood.
"Almost all antidepressants have some effect on monoaminergic transmission in the brain, and many of them also have other related characteristics."
"Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors The monoamine oxidase enzyme, which catabolizes dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, is inhibited by MAOIs."
The earliest antidepressants to be identified were monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
"Because of its side effects and potential for drug interactions, MAOIs are not recommended as a first-line treatment for depression."
Drugs • Selegiline • Moclobemide • Tranylcypromine • Isocarboxazid • Phenelzine • Clorgyline Adverse effects • Nausea • Dizziness • Headache • Insomnia • Rarely Excitement • Liver Damage • Potential for serotonin syndrome • Sexual dysfunction 
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) A family of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is most frequently administered to treat depression.
"Because of their safety, effectiveness, and tolerability, they are frequently used as first-line pharmacotherapy for depression and many other mental illnesses."
The use of these in adult and pediatric patients is authorized.
Drugs • Sertraline • Fluvoxamine • Fluoxetine • Paroxetine • Citalopram • Escitalopram
Adverse effects • Sexual dysfunction • Headache • QTc prolongation • Nausea • Vomiting • Loose Motions • Dizziness • Occasionally Insomnia
Atypical Antidepressants An atypical antidepressant is an antidepressant medication that acts in a manner that is different from that of most other antidepressants.
"Typical antidepressants include SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs, which act mainly by increasing the levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters, serotonin, and/or norepinephrine."
Drugs • Trazodone • Mianserin • Mirtazapine • Bupropion • Amoxapine • Tianeptine • Amineptine
"Adverse effects • Agomelatine- hepatotoxicity • Mirtazapine-Sedation, Weight gain • Bupropion- Seizures • Trazodone - Arrhythmia • Mianserin - blood dyscrasias, liver dysfunction"
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) constitute a class of medications used to manage and treat major depressive disorder
(MDD).
"These medications function by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and"
"norepinephrine, which can modulate mood, attention, and pain in individuals."
TCAs are now regarded as second-line
treatment options alongside selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
"They acquired the name ""tricyclic"" due to"
the presence of 3 rings in their chemical structure.
Drugs • Amitriptyline • Clomipramine • Doxepin • Imipramine • Trimipramine • Desipramine • Nortriptyline • Protriptyline • Maprotiline • Amoxapine 
Adverse effects • Dry mouth • Urinary Retention • Constipation • QRS prolongation • Seizures • Orthostatic Hypotension 
Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) The serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are a family of antidepressants that inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine.
"Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) block serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake in the synapse, increasing postsynaptic receptors' stimulation."
The affinity of SNRIs for the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters varies.
Drugs • Venlafaxine • Desvenlafaxine • Duloxetine • Milnacipran • Levomilnacipran
Adverse effects • Hypertension • Headache • Diaphoresis • Bone resorption
"Psychotherapy Psychotherapy (also psychological therapy, talk therapy, or talking therapy) is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change behaviour, increase happiness, and overcome problems."
"Psychotherapy seeks to improve an individual's well-being and mental health by resolving or mitigating problematic behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, as well as improving relationships and social skills."
"Psychotherapy can help you: • Adjust to a crisis or other current difficulty • Identify negative beliefs and behaviors and replace them with healthy, positive ones • Explore relationships and experiences, and develop positive interactions with others • Find better ways to cope and solve problems • Identify issues that contribute to your depression and change behaviors that make it worse • Regain a sense of satisfaction and control in your life and help ease depression symptoms, such as hopelessness and anger • Learn to set realistic goals for your life • Develop the ability to tolerate and accept distress using healthier behaviors."
Approaches to psychotherapy Approaches to psychotherapy fall into five broad categories:
"Psychoanalysis And Psychodynamic Therapies This approach focuses on changing problematic behaviours, feelings, and thoughts by discovering their unconscious meanings and motivations."
A tight working connection between therapist and patient distinguishes psychoanalytically oriented therapies.
Patients discover more about themselves through their interactions in the therapy partnership.
"While Sigmund Freud is closely associated with psychoanalysis, it has been developed and modified since his early formulations."
Behaviour Therapy This approach emphasizes on the role of learning in the development of both normal and pathological behaviors.
"Ivan Pavlov contributed significantly to behavior therapy by discovering classical conditioning, often known as associative learning."
"When Pavlov's famous dogs heard their dinner bell, they began drooling because they associated the sound with food."
"""Desensitizing"" is classical conditioning in action: A therapist may help a client with a phobia by repeatedly exposing him or her to whatever generates anxiety."
"E.L. Thorndike, who discovered operant conditioning, was another influential thinker."
"To modify people's behavior, this sort of learning uses rewards and penalties."
Several versions have emerged since the introduction of behavior therapy in the 1950s.
"Cognitive-behavioral therapy, for example, focuses on both thoughts and behaviors."
Cognitive Therapy Cognitive therapy focuses on what people think as opposed to what they do.
Cognitive therapists believe that faulty thinking is the source of dysfunctional emotions or behaviors.
People can change how they feel and what they do by changing their thinking.
Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck are two major figures in cognitive therapy.
Humanistic Therapy This approach emphasizes people's ability to make reasonable decisions and reach their full potential.
Concern for others is another significant element.
"This style of treatment was influenced by humanistic philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Buber, and Sren Kierkegaard."
Three types of humanistic therapy are very effective.
Client-centered treatment opposes the notion of therapists as experts on their clients' inner lives.
"Therapists instead assist clients in changing by stressing their concern, caring, and interest."
"Gestalt treatment emphasizes ""organismic holism,"" or the significance of being aware of the here and now and taking personal responsibility."
"Existential therapy is concerned with free choice, self-determination, and the quest for meaning."
Integrative Or Holistic Therapy Many therapists do not adhere to a single technique.
"Instead, they combine aspects from many approaches and personalize their treatment to the specific needs of each client."
"Brain stimulation therapy If medication or psychotherapy do not relieve depression symptoms, brain stimulation therapy may be an alternative to consider."
"There are now various types of brain stimulation therapy, some of which are FDA-approved for the treatment of depression."
"Although brain stimulation techniques are less commonly utilized than medication and psychotherapy, they can be effective in treating persons with mental problems who have not responded to other treatments."
Brain stimulation therapies work by electrically activating or inhibiting the brain.
Electricity is delivered either directly or indirectly through electrodes implanted in the brain or electrodes placed on the scalp.
Applying magnetic fields to the head can also induce electricity.
The brain stimulation therapies with the largest bodies of evidence include: • Electroconvulsive therapy • Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation • Vagus nerve stimulation • Magnetic seizure therapy • Deep brain stimulation
"Conclusion In conclusion, depression is a complicated mental disorder influenced by a variety of biological, psychological, and environmental factors."
"Changes in neurotransmitter systems, neuroendocrine function, and brain plasticity are all part of the pathophysiology of depression."
"An issue with the biological clock, which results in sleep disorders and irregular biorhythms, is the primary cause of depression."
Antidepressants and psychotherapies are the foundations of an integrated approach to treating depression.
Antidepressants reduce the symptoms of depression by regulating brain chemicals that regulate mood and emotions.
"On the other side, patients are given strategies and resources to deal with depressive thoughts and behaviors during psychotherapies."
"Both treatments have been proven effective, but their success largely depends on individual factors such as the severity of depression, the patient's personal circumstances, and their response to treatment."
"Therefore, a personalized treatment plan, often involving a combination of both methods, is typically the most effective way to treat depression, but if medication or psychotherapy does not reduce the symptoms of depression, then brain stimulation therapies can be considered as an alternative."
"Compliance with ethical standards Acknowledgment I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Swati P. Deshmukh, Mr. H. K. Rathod, and Mr. V. A. Katekar, whose expertise and guidance have been instrumental in shaping this article."
I would like to thank my friends and family for their unwavering encouragement and understanding.
"I would like to especially thank my sister, Miss Amisha A. Khune, for directing my interest towards psychology."
Your passion for the subject and your encouragement have played a significant role in sparking my curiosity and motivating me to delve deeper into the study of depressive disorders.
"Furthermore, I would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to all the researchers, authors, and professionals whose work I have referenced in this article."
"Once again, I extend my heartfelt appreciation to everyone who has contributed to this review article."
Disclosure of conflict of interest No conflict of interest to be disclosed.
The role of the physical workspace in employee mental health is often overlooked.
"As a (mentally) healthy workforce is vital for an organisation’s success, it is important to optimise office workspace conditions."
Previous studies on the effects of the physical workspace on mental health tended to focus on the effects of a specific element of the physical workspace on one or only a few mental health indicators.
This study takes a more holistic approach by addressing the relationship of physical workspace characteristics with ten broad indicators of work-related mental health.
"Results of a systematic review of empirical evidence show that many aspects of (day)light, office layout/design, and temperature and thermal comfort have been proven to be related to many mental health indicators."
"Less tacit workspace characteristics (e.g., noise, use of colours) have been explored too, but so far have only been related to a few mental health indicators."
Practitioner summary: The absence of holistic insights regarding the empirical proof of the effects of workspace design on employee mental health prevents a clear business case for workplace investments.
This paper presents a content analysis of existing studies and shows how seven elements of workspace design relate to 10 mental health indicators.
"PRISMA guidelines to select these 133 papers from an initial database of 3695 papers, based on several eligibility criteria."
Detailed information about the selection procedure.
The current study adds a content analysis of the same articles.
Data was extracted from each paper on general paper information (e.g.
"author, year, journal), the research design, time horizon, and methods, number of buildings in the study, layout of the office(s), physical workplace characteristics, mental health indicators, and the direction and significance of relationships between physical workspace characteristics and mental health indicators."
"Next, the elements of the physical workspace (e.g."
"Temperature and Thermal Comfort) and their components [e.g., room temperature ( �C) and relative humidity (%)] that were empirically tested (see Figure 1), were extracted from each study."
"Per element, relationships of the associated components with the ten mental health indicators are gathered (positive, negative, curvilinear, no effect)."
"Various studies also reported percentages for possible effect sizes that were measured (e.g., 3% increase in productivity)."
"Last, the design quality levels of the different components were allocated to three categories (insufficient, sufficient, and optimal) based on the empirical findings in the papers that indicated thresholds for component values that positively or negatively affected mental health indicators."
These three categories allow to identify optimisation possibilities and their potential for a positive business case based on mental health outcomes.
"As this study is a review of literature, no ethical approval was necessary."
"The offices studied in the papers regarded open plan offices (n ¼ 64 studies), cellular offices (n ¼ 39), shared offices (n ¼ 20), combi offices (n ¼ 4), and activitybased offices (n ¼ 14)."
"Overall, 97% of the studies used a survey, with 50% using a longitudinal approach (with one pre-test and at least two posttests)."
"Several studies combined the use of a survey with a field experiment, as field experiments were used in 30% of the papers."
"Sample sizes ranged from 7 to 25,947 respondents, with an average of 887 (SD ¼ 2832) and from 1 to 191 different office buildings (M ¼ 11, SD ¼ 25)."
The journals that the papers were published in (see Supplementary Material) give some indication of the research fields.
"On the hand, there were 17 journals that could be said to stem from the field of building sciences (with 49 studies) and six journals (with 29 studies) from the field of ergonomics, facilities, and real estate."
"Regarding mental health, many of these studies focussed on the salutogenic indicators of productivity and concentration."
"The building’s science journals appear more focussed on indoor environmental qualities (IEQ: temperature, air, lighting, and noise), whereas the ergonomics, facilities, and real estate journals additional include office layout and design."
"On the other hand, there were many journals included with the main focus on people instead of the spaces, from the field of medicine and health (12 journals with 21 studies) and psychology and behaviour (four journals with 17 studies)."
"These studies seem a bit more focussed on pathogenic indicators, especially stress."
"Regarding workspaces, again the IEQ elements are studied most here."
"Five journals (with six studies) are nature focussed, mainly on relating biophilia to stress."
Eight journals (with 11 studies) were hard to assign to a specific field.
Office layout and office design The workspace element ‘office layout and office design’ considers components related to the physical and functional settings of the workspace as well as its design.
"Its ten components (see Table 1) are shown to have significant relationships with most mental health indicators, but not (yet) with mood, depression, or fatigue."
"All components have been related to perceived productivity, and most to stress and well-being as well."
"Contrary to most other workspace elements, measured changes in mental health have not yet been indicated in percentages."
"In general, mostly perceptive measures of satisfaction are used to measure the layout, but five studies included an objective metric (e.g., workspace size)."
"Regarding office type (related to five mental health indicators), three main categories are distinguished: private offices, group offices, and open plan offices."
"The private office relates most positively—in comparison to the open plan office—to well-being and sleep quality, productivity, concentration, and reduced stress levels."
The strength of the relationships of group office with these mental health indicators lies in between those of the two other office types.
"Besides office layout design, flexible use of individual workspaces relates more positively to productivity and stress levels than dedicated seating."
"In addition to the office layout in its entirety, the availability of concentration spaces and breakout rooms also relates to higher productivity  and higher overall wellbeing."
"Similarly, vitality zones and active elements (e.g., exercise balls, standing desks, table tennis tables, lounge chairs, etc.)"
reduce stress and burnout-related symptoms.
"also reported an increase in sleep quality, productivity, and engagement for such components."
"On top of that, people in workspaces with easy access to facilities that sup - port them in their everyday tasks perceive higher productivity."
Call for a clear separation of refreshment areas from workspaces as these areas cause distractions that negatively affect employee productivity and concentration.
"Overview Mental health is the aggregation of emotional, social and psychological well-being of a person."
"It effects on the person’s thinking, acting and feeling capability."
Mental health is a measure of handling stress and decision making with every step-in life.
Mental Health is very important factor in every stage in life whether it be childhood or an adult.
"Mostly mental health is something which never discussed publicly, and no proper awareness is there in society."
People would generally not talk about it in public.
Mental health could affect one’s thinking and behavior.
"Some common reasons of instable mental health could be: 1) Past life experiences, such as ragging or bullying 2) Biological factors, such as genes 3) Hereditary problem from family"
"Methodologies Artificial neural networks are computing that were inspired by biological neural networks of the animals’ brains (though many scientists believe that actual brains are much more complex systems than artificial neural networks it has much more units, signals are transferred differently etc)."
The artificial neural networks consist of units (generally grouped by layers) and connections between them.
"Each of these connections has a corresponding weight, which are modified during learning process as per Figure 1."
"There is no formal definition of deep neural network, but usually it is assumed that neural network is deep if it has more than one hidden layer (not input or output layer)."
Deep learning is a set of learning methods attempting to model data with complex architectures combining different non-linear transformations.
"The elementary bricks of deep learning are the neural networks, that are combined to form the deep neural networks."
"These techniques have enabled significant progress in the fields of sound and image processing, including facial recognition, speech recognition, computer vision, automated language processing, text classification (for example spam recognition)."
Potential applications are very numerous.
"A spectacularly example is the AlphaGo program, which learned to play the go game by the deep learning method, and beat the world champion in 2016."
"There exist several types of architectures for neural networks: 1) The multilayer perceptron’s, that are the oldest and simplest ones 2) The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), particularly adapted for image processing 3) The recurrent neural networks, used for sequential data such as text or times series C. Problem Statement Scope of mental health maintenance isn’t solely a requirement of seeing a mental health professional, but rather creating a routine of self-check ins, and proper maintenance of our mental states."
(BUT seeing a mental health professional is still a wholesome experience that doesn’t require being diagnosed with a specific condition.
I still highly recommend it.)
Classification Accuracy: it is a measure of correct predictions in percentage and Confusion Matrix which display Tabular format to describe performance of model.
II.
"LITERATURE SURVEY Age, sex, marital status, socio-economic conditions, family environment, literacy, job security, past history of depression, chronic medical conditions are strongly associated with the anxiety and depression among the older people [1-3]."
Those factors can be used as predictors for the development of an automated anxiety and depression prediction system.
"Predictor variables can be put into the automated system by any one, not necessarily to be a medical or paramedical person including patient himself and based on its prediction can be made within seconds."
This is a binary class classification problem.
Different machine learning algorithms can handle this kind of health-related classification issues very efficiently [4].
Ten different classifiers were employed and evaluated to select the optimal one with the selected set of features.
"These are Bayesian Network (BN), logistic, multiple layer perceptron (MLP), Naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), random tree (RT), J48, sequential minimal optimisation (SMO), random sub-space (RS), and K Star (KS)."
Those ten different classifiers represent different principles applied in machine learning.
"Such as BN and NB are based on Bayesian principle, logistic based on regression principle, MLP follows feed forward artificial neural network modelling, RT, and J48 are decision tree-based classifiers, whereas RF is an ensemble learning method, SMO used for training of support vector machine (SVM), KS is an instance-based classifier which uses entropy-based distance function and RS is a meta classifier based on bagging."
The prediction of model is based on small number of sample size and is hardly generalizable.
The proposed model predicts depression risk context in the combination with DNN and context information.
It is used to predict the potential context influencing the risk of depression.
"In this way, the risk of depression is predicted."
"Regression analysis, which is often used in statistics, mathematically estimates linear correlations between data with the use of regression [5]."
"As variables, independent variables (cause) and dependent variables (result) are used [6]."
Regression analysis is distinguished into simple regression analysis and multiple regression analysis according to the number of independent variables.
Depression can incur in diverse context so that independent variables are multiple.
"In multiple regression analyses, the variables for predicting the risk of depression are extracted."
"At this time, a significance level is applied."
"In addition, a regression equation is extracted."
"The risk of depression is set as a target variable, and a context variable for predicting depression is set as an independent variable."
A significance level represents the stochastic precision of judgment in the hypothesis test.
DNN (Deep Neural Network) has the structure of multiple hidden layers between the input layer and the output layer [7].
"In this case, the number of nodes in the input layer is determined by the feature of sample data."
"In the hidden layer, it is possible to learn relations of a variety of nonlinear data."
"Also, complex nonlinear problems can be solved, and a variety of information can be extracted from high-dimensional data."
"In the hidden layer connected with the input layer, it is possible to combine with a value of input variable, give a weight, extract a new value, and deliver it to the output layer."
The drawback of these paper is Discovery for relation using regression analysis is difficult.
"This paper aims to synthesise the literature on machine learning (ML) and big data applications [8] for mental health, highlighting current research and applications in practice."
Methods We employed a scoping review methodology to rapidly map the field of ML in mental health.
Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain.
"Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data was extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results."
Articles were then synthesised via a narrative review.
Results Three hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified.
"Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration."
"The most common mental health conditions addressed include depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease."
"ML techniques used include support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering."
"Conclusions Overall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration."
"With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health."
"The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as opportunities to improve and advance the field."
No in-depth details about actual algorithms are discussed in the paper.
"Although many papers and application created AI in healthcare with one basic function, this paper [8] found that rarely findings allow the patients to read their own diseases, particularly supporting both patients and doctors in payment."
Mostly AI has been using for doctors to analyse the disease ‘s symptom.
"Besides that, we are building the AI model in order to create a mobile application which helps patients know more about their health problems."
"Moreover, [9] with the combination of AI and Blockchain to have the function of payment on the application, AI as a virtual nurse could communicate to doctors, insurance companies, drug companies, hospitals to let them know how much they have to pay for the patients, what kind of medicine the patients take."
"Hence, the target reader is the relevant stakeholders such as doctors, patients, drug companies, hospitals, insurance companies."
"From the gap of previous findings and model of Blockchain in healthcare by author (2018)3, this paper will build three 2Researchers from NYU Langine Health found that AI could find and match specific lung nodes (on chest CT images) between 62% to 97% faster than a panel of radiologists."
"In Blockchain in healthcare: a new technology benefit for both patients and doctors, (Tran Le Nguyen, PICMET 2018), [10] author created model using Blockchain to store and manage data of surgery more effectively and facilitate many related parties access data quickly and safely."
"Models of AI with three main functions of AI: booking an appointment, analysing the results of surgery, announcing patients and stakeholders know how much they have to pay the fee of surgery."
There was a high computational complexity observed in the system.
Mental health problems affect many employees — a fact that is usually overlooked because these disorders tend to be hidden at work.
"Researchers analysing results from the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey, a nationally representative study of Americans ages 15 to 54, reported that 18% of those who were employed said they experienced symptoms of a mental health disorder in the previous month."
[11] But the stigma attached to having a psychiatric disorder is such that employees may be reluctant to seek treatment — especially in the current economic climate — out of fear that they might jeopardize their jobs.
"At the same time, managers may want to help but aren't sure how to do so."
"And clinicians may find themselves in unfamiliar territory, simultaneously trying to treat a patient while providing advice about dealing with the illness at work."
"[12] As a result, mental health disorders often go unrecognized and untreated — not only damaging an individual's health and career, but also reducing productivity at work."
"Adequate treatment, on the other hand, can alleviate symptoms for the employee and improve job performance."
But accomplishing these aims requires a shift in attitudes about the nature of mental disorders and the recognition that such a worthwhile achievement takes effort and time.
"[13] The most common mental health problems in the workplace, and how they affect both employees and employers."
But in this Software approach is not discussed.
III.
PROPOSED METHODOLOGY A.
Existing Solutions In Existing system doctors take the information from the patients manually and then have to study the characteristics for days in order to come to the conclusion regarding his/her Mental condition.
This takes large amount of time and requires large labor to perform the task.
Inappropriate diagnosis of the mental health could lead to incorrect treatment.
This could in long run prove to be as fatal as premature death.
Hence this paper introduces a new approach as semi-automated system.
This system will diagnose psychological disorder in patient.
"This is achieved by comparing patient’s mental health with the DSM-IV-TR, fourth edition revision."
"[14] Here they are using genetic algorithm, classification and machine learning techniques to build semi-automated system."
The final future goal is to fully automate the system unless it meets the required standards of identifying patient’s mental illness.
The classifier had an assessment of a patient as accurate as possible.
The final call will be of analyst for treatment of patient.
People with mental disorder often face other anxiety disorder which eventually develops into depression.
Hence authors are interested in online communities for data.
"They have crawled data from 247 online communities of 80,000 users."
"Then they have extracted the psycho- linguistic posts based on topics, which served as input to model."
Machine learning techniques are applied to generate joint model for identifying mental health related features.
"At last, they performed empirical validation of model on dataset where model performs best in recent techniques and the flow chart is mentioned in Figure 2."
"With outburst of social media usage [15], health scientists have become more active, particularly for data related to disease epidemics and analyze warning signals of mental health issues."
"In this paper also, they have focused on precursor, cognitive distortion and symptoms of psychological behavior like anorexia, anxiety and depression."
"SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine shown in Fig 3."
"The code for SQLite is in the public domain and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private."
"SQLite is the most widely deployed database in the world with more applications than we can count, including several high-profile projects as per Figure 4 -8."
In these given a flexibility to the user to interact with the system using GUI manner for easy access of the developed project.
Once the uploading of data is done then the client side the user can make a registration to the doctor by filling of his details as well as the doctor can do make registration by providing the details of his specialization.
After successful login to the portal the doctor can search for the patient based on the details like id or name etc.
As the details of illness of a patient are detected in the backend the prediction done using 3 algorithms and maximum shown accuracy algorithm results are considered as final prediction.
An ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) is a graph [Figure 10-11] showing the performance of a classification model at all classification thresholds.
This curve plots two parameters: True Positive Rate.
False Positive Rate.
There are many suggestions that employers and employees could keep in mind.
Employers need to keep track of number of their employees having mental disorder.
Employers should allow flexible work environment with flexible work scheduling and break timings.
They should allow employees to work from home or have flexible place of work.
They should give day-to- day feedback and guidance for nurturing employees’ health.
This type of model could be used to detect metal health progress among employees and also could lead to policy changes.
Employees could talk to colleagues and their managers about their problem freely.
"Hence upper management could help them to get correct aid with beneficiaries like work from home, flexible timings, more leaves, many more."
Employees should know health benefits provided by their organization participate in any wellness programs.
Proper feedback should be provided to employee when they resign from their job.
This could help them to improve their health.
"At every interval of months, the survey should be taken in IT companies to know how well their employees are."
It should be a rule that should be embedded in their policy book.
This project could further be developed with beautification and could potentially be attached to stack of default software in an organization.

Overview - Agoraphobia
Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn't be available if things go wrong.
"Many people assume agoraphobia is simply a fear of open spaces, but it's actually a more complex condition."
Someone with agoraphobia may be scared of:
""
travelling on public transport
visiting a shopping centre
leaving home
"If someone with agoraphobia finds themselves in a stressful situation, they'll usually experience the symptoms of a panic attack, such as:"
""
rapid heartbeat
rapid breathing (hyperventilating)
feeling hot and sweaty
feeling sick
They'll avoid situations that cause anxiety and may only leave the house with a friend or partner.
They'll order groceries online rather than going to the supermarket.
This change in behaviour is known as avoidance.
Read more about the symptoms of agoraphobia.
What causes agoraphobia?
"Agoraphobia can develop as a complication of panic disorder, an anxiety disorder involving panic attacks and moments of intense fear."
It can arise by associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occurred and then avoiding them.
Not all people with agoraphobia have a history of panic attacks.
"In these cases, their fear may be related to issues like a fear of crime, terrorism, illness or being in an accident."
Read more about the possible causes of agoraphobia.
Diagnosing agoraphobia
Speak to your GP if you think you may be affected by agoraphobia.
It should be possible to arrange a telephone consultation if you don't feel ready to visit your GP in person.
"Your GP will ask you to describe your symptoms, how often they occur, and in what situations."
It's very important you tell them how you've been feeling and how your symptoms are affecting you.
Your GP may ask you the following questions:
""
Do you find leaving the house stressful?
Are there certain places or situations you have to avoid?
"Do you have any avoidance strategies to help you cope with your symptoms, such as relying on others to shop for you?"
"It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions, and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed."
Your GP needs to know as much as possible about your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment.
Read more about diagnosing agoraphobia.
Treating agoraphobia
"Lifestyle changes may help, including taking regular exercise, eating more healthily, and avoiding alcohol, drugs and drinks that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola."
"Self-help techniques that can help during a panic attack include staying where you are, focusing on something that's non-threatening and visible, and slow, deep breathing."
"If your agoraphobia fails to respond to these treatment methods, see your GP."
"You can also refer yourself directly for talking therapies, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), without seeing your GP."

"If you’re under 18, or want to get help for someone under 18, find out how to get mental health support for children and young people."
Medication may be recommended if self-help techniques and lifestyle changes aren't effective in controlling your symptoms.
"You'll usually be prescribed a course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are also used to treat anxiety and depression."
"In severe cases of agoraphobia, medication can be used in combination with other types of treatment, such as CBT and relaxation therapy."
Read more about treating agoraphobia.
Overview - Anorexia nervosa
Anorexia nervosa (often called anorexia) is an eating disorder and serious mental health condition.
People who have anorexia try to keep their weight as low as possible.
"They may do this in different ways, such as not eating enough food, exercising too much, taking laxatives or making themselves sick (vomit)."
This can make them very ill because they start to starve.
"They often have a distorted image of their bodies, thinking they're fat even when they're underweight."
"Men and women of any age can get anorexia, but it's most common in young women and typically starts in the mid-teens."
Signs and symptoms of anorexia
Signs and symptoms of anorexia include:
""
"if you're under 18, your weight and height being lower than the minimum expected for your age"
"if you're an adult, having an unusually low body mass index (BMI)"
missing meals or eating very little
"thinking about food a lot and being very careful about what you eat, such as avoiding eating any foods you see as fattening"
believing you're fat when you're a healthy weight or underweight
your periods stopping (in women who have not reached menopause) or not starting (in younger women and girls)
"physical problems, such as feeling lightheaded or dizzy, hair loss or dry skin"
Some people with anorexia may also make themselves sick or do an extreme amount of exercise.
"Some use medicines to reduce their hunger (appetite suppressants), help them poo (laxatives) or make them pee (diuretics) to try to stop themselves gaining weight from any food they do eat."
Getting help for anorexia
Getting help and support as soon as possible gives you the best chance of recovering from anorexia.
"If you think you may have anorexia, even if you're not sure, see a GP as soon as you can."
They will ask you questions about your eating habits and how you're feeling.
"They will probably weigh you, and check your heart rate, blood pressure and temperature."
They may also want to do some blood tests and to check your overall physical health.
"If they think you may have anorexia, or another eating disorder, they should refer you to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists."
It can be very hard to admit you have a problem and to ask for help.
It may make things easier if you bring a friend or loved one with you to your appointment.
You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from eating disorders charity Beat by calling its helpline on 0808 801 0677.
Getting help for someone else
"If you're concerned that a family member or friend may have anorexia, let them know you're worried about them and encourage them to see a GP."
You could offer to go along with them.
Read more about advice for parents on eating disorders and how to help someone with an eating disorder.
Treatment for anorexia
"You can recover from anorexia, but it may take time and recovery will be different for everyone."
"Your treatment plan will be tailored to you and should consider any other support you might need, such as for depression or anxiety."
"If you're over 18, you should be offered a type of talking therapy to help you manage your feelings about food and eating so that you are able to eat enough to be healthy."
Talking therapies that are commonly used to treat anorexia in adults include:
""
cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
Maudsley anorexia nervosa treatment for adults (MANTRA)
specialist supportive clinical management (SSCM)
"If you're under 18, you should be offered family therapy."
"You may also be offered another type of talking therapy, such as CBT or adolescent-focused psychotherapy."
Find out how to get mental health support for children and young people.
Health risks of anorexia
Long-term anorexia can lead to severe health problems associated with not getting the right nutrients (malnutrition).
But these will usually begin to get better once your food intake starts improving.
Possible complications include:
""
"problems with muscles and bones – including feeling tired and weak, osteoporosis, and problems with physical development in children and young adults"
fertility problems
loss of sex drive
"problems with the heart and blood vessels – including poor circulation, an irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, heart valve disease, heart failure, and swollen ankles, feet and legs (oedema)"
"problems with the brain and nerves – including difficulties with concentration and memory or, less often, fits (seizures)"
kidney or bowel problems
having a weakened immune system or anaemia
Anorexia can also put your life at risk.
It's one of the leading causes of deaths related to mental health problems.
Deaths from anorexia may be due to physical complications or suicide.
Causes of anorexia
We do not know exactly what causes anorexia and other eating disorders.
You may be more likely to get an eating disorder if:
""
"you or a member of your family has a history of eating disorders, depression, or alcohol or drug addiction"
"you have been criticised for your eating habits, body shape or weight"
"you're overly concerned with being slim, particularly if you also feel pressure from society or your job – for example, ballet dancers, jockeys, models or athletes"
"you have anxiety, low self-esteem, an obsessive personality or are a perfectionist"
"you have been emotionally, physically or sexually abused"
Antisocial personality disorder
"Personality disorders are mental health conditions that affect how someone thinks, perceives, feels or relates to others."
"Antisocial personality disorder is a particularly challenging type of personality disorder characterised by impulsive, irresponsible and often criminal behaviour."
"Someone with antisocial personality disorder will typically be manipulative, deceitful and reckless, and will not care for other people's feelings."
"Like other types of personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder is on a spectrum, which means it can range in severity from occasional bad behaviour to repeatedly breaking the law and committing serious crimes."
Psychopaths are considered to have a severe form of antisocial personality disorder.
The Mind website has more information about signs of antisocial personality disorder

Signs of antisocial personality disorder
A person with antisocial personality disorder may:
""
"exploit, manipulate or violate the rights of others"
"lack concern, regret or remorse about other people's distress"
behave irresponsibly and show disregard for normal social behaviour
have difficulty sustaining long-term relationships
be unable to control their anger
"lack guilt, or not learn from their mistakes"
blame others for problems in their lives
repeatedly break the law
"A person with antisocial personality disorder will have a history of conduct disorder during childhood, such as truancy (not going to school), delinquency (for example, committing crimes or substance misuse), and other disruptive and aggressive behaviours."
Who develops antisocial personality disorder?
Antisocial personality disorder affects more men than women.
"It's not known why some people develop antisocial personality disorder, but both genetics and traumatic childhood experiences, such as child abuse or neglect, are thought to play a role."
A person with antisocial personality disorder will have often grown up in difficult family circumstances.
"One or both parents may misuse alcohol, and parental conflict and harsh, inconsistent parenting are common."
"As a result of these problems, social services may become involved with the child's care."
These types of difficulties in childhood will often lead to behavioural problems during adolescence and adulthood.
Effects of antisocial personality disorder
"Criminal behaviour is a key feature of antisocial personality disorder, and there's a high risk that someone with the disorder will commit crimes and be imprisoned at some point in their life."
Men with antisocial personality disorder have been found to be 3 to 5 times more likely than women to misuse alcohol and drugs than those without the disorder.
They also have an increased risk of dying prematurely as a result of reckless behaviour or attempting suicide.
People with antisocial personality disorder are also more likely to have relationship problems during adulthood and be unemployed and homeless.
Diagnosing antisocial personality disorder
"To be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a person will usually have a history of conduct personality disorder before the age of 15."
Antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed after rigorous detailed psychological assessment.
A diagnosis can only be made if the person is aged 18 years or older and at least 3 of the following criteria behaviours apply:
""
repeatedly breaking the law
repeatedly being deceitful
being impulsive or incapable of planning ahead
being irritable and aggressive
having a reckless disregard for their safety or the safety of others
being consistently irresponsible
lack of remorse
These signs are not part of a schizophrenic or manic episode – they're part of a person's everyday personality and behaviour.
This behaviour usually becomes most extreme and challenging during the late teens and early 20s.
It may improve by the time the person reaches their 40s.
Treating antisocial personality disorder
"In the past, antisocial personality disorder was thought to be a lifelong disorder, but that's not always the case and it can sometimes be managed and treated."
"Evidence suggests behaviour can improve over time with therapy, even if core characteristics such as lack of empathy remain."
But antisocial personality disorder is one of the most difficult types of personality disorders to treat.
A person with antisocial personality disorder may also be reluctant to seek treatment and may only start therapy when ordered to do so by a court.
"The recommended treatment for someone with antisocial personality disorder will depend on their circumstances, taking into account factors such as age, offending history and whether there are any associated problems, such as alcohol or drug misuse."
The person's family and friends will often play an active role in making decisions about their treatment and care.
"Sometimes, substance misuse services and social care may also need to be involved."
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE): management and prevention of antisocial personality disorder
""
Talking therapies
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is sometimes used to treat antisocial personality disorder.
It's a talking therapy that aims to help a person manage their problems by changing the way they think and behave.
Mentalisation-based therapy (MBT) is another type of talking therapy that's becoming more popular in the treatment of antisocial personality disorder.
The therapist will encourage the person to consider the way they think and how their mental state affects their behaviour.
Democratic therapeutic communities (DTC)
"Evidence suggests community-based programmes can be an effective long-term treatment method for people with antisocial personality disorder, and is becoming increasingly popular in prisons."
"DTC is a type of social therapy that aims to address the person's risk of offending, as well as their emotional and psychological needs."
"It's based around large and small therapy groups and focuses on community issues, creating an environment where both staff and prisoners contribute to the decisions of the community."
There may also be opportunities for educational and vocational work.
"The recommended length of treatment is 18 months, as there needs to be enough time for a person to make changes and put new skills into practice."
Self-motivation is another important factor for acceptance on to this type of scheme.
"For example, the person must be willing to work as part of a community, participate in groups, and be subject to the democratic process."

Medicine
"There's little evidence to support the use of medicine for treating antisocial personality disorder, but certain antipsychotic and antidepressant medicines may be helpful in some instances."
"Carbamazepine and lithium may help control symptoms such as aggression and impulsive behaviour, and a class of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may improve anger and general personality disorder symptoms."
Overview - Binge eating disorder
Binge eating disorder involves regularly eating a lot of food over a short period of time until you're uncomfortably full.
It's a serious mental health condition where people eat without feeling like they’re in control of what they’re doing.
"Binges are sometimes planned in advance, but can be spontaneous."
"They are usually done alone, and may include ""special"" binge foods."
You may feel guilty or ashamed after binge eating.
"Men and women of any age can get binge eating disorder, but it often starts when people are in their 20s or older."
Symptoms of binge eating disorder
The main symptom of binge eating disorder is eating a lot of food in a short time and not being able to stop when full.
Other symptoms include:
""
eating when not hungry
eating very fast during a binge
eating alone or secretly
"feeling depressed, guilty, ashamed or disgusted after binge eating"
People who regularly eat in this way may have binge eating disorder.
Warning signs of binge eating disorder in someone else
Someone you care about may have an eating disorder if they:
""
change their behaviour or have changes in their mood
"eat a lot of food, very quickly"
try to hide how much they're eating
store up supplies of food
put on weight (but this does not happen to everyone with binge eating disorder)
Getting help for binge eating disorder
"If you think you may have binge eating disorder, see a GP as soon as you can."
"They'll ask you about your eating habits and how you're feeling, and check your weight and overall health."
The GP should refer you to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists if they think you have binge eating disorder or another eating disorder.
"It can be hard to admit you need help with an eating disorder, so bringing a friend or loved one with you to your appointment may help."
You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from eating disorders charity Beat by calling its adult helpline on 0808 801 0677 or youth helpline on 0808 801 0711.
Getting help for someone else

Overview - Bipolar disorder
"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that affects your moods, which can swing from 1 extreme to another."
It used to be known as manic depression.
Symptoms of bipolar disorder
People with bipolar disorder have episodes of:
""
depression – feeling very low and lethargic
mania – feeling very high and overactive
Symptoms of bipolar disorder depend on which mood you're experiencing.
"Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks (or even longer)."
Depression
"You may initially be diagnosed with clinical depression before you have a manic episode, after which you may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder."
"During an episode of depression, you may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide."
"If you're feeling suicidal, call 999 or go to your nearest A&E department as soon as possible."
"If you're feeling very depressed, contact a GP, your care co-ordinator or get help from NHS 111 if you're not sure what to do."
You can call 111 or get help from 111 online.
"If you want to talk to someone confidentially, call the Samaritans free on 116 123."
"You can talk to them 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
Or visit the Samaritans website or email jo@samaritans.org.
Mania
"During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, you may:"
""
feel very happy
"have lots of energy, ambitious plans and ideas"
spend large amounts of money on things you cannot afford and would not normally want
It's also common to:
""
not feel like eating or sleeping
talk quickly
become annoyed easily
You may feel very creative and view the manic phase of bipolar as a positive experience.
"But you may also experience symptoms of psychosis, where you see or hear things that are not there or become convinced of things that are not true."
Treatments for bipolar disorder
The high and low phases of bipolar disorder are often so extreme that they interfere with everyday life.
But there are several options for treating bipolar disorder that can make a difference.
They aim to control the effects of an episode and help someone with bipolar disorder live life as normally as possible.
The following treatment options are available:
""
"medicine to prevent episodes of mania and depression – these are known as mood stabilisers, and you take them every day on a long-term basis"
medicine to treat the main symptoms of depression and mania when they happen
learning to recognise the triggers and signs of an episode of depression or mania
"psychological treatment – such as talking therapy, which can help you deal with depression, and provides advice about how to improve your relationships"
"lifestyle advice – such as doing regular exercise, planning activities you enjoy that give you a sense of achievement, as well as advice on improving your diet and getting more sleep"
It's thought using a combination of different treatment methods is the best way to control bipolar disorder.
"Help and advice for people with a long-term condition or their carers is also available from charities, support groups and associations."
This includes self-help and learning to deal with the practical aspects of a long-term condition.

What causes bipolar disorder?
"The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, although it's believed a number of things can trigger an episode."
These include:
""
extreme stress
overwhelming problems
life-changing events
genetic and chemical factors
Who's affected
"Bipolar disorder is fairly common, and around 1 in every 100 people will be diagnosed with it at some point in their life."
"Bipolar disorder can occur at any age, although it often develops between the ages of 15 and 19."
Men and women from all backgrounds are equally likely to develop bipolar disorder.
The pattern of mood swings in bipolar disorder varies widely.
"For example, some people only have a couple of bipolar episodes in their lifetime and are stable in between, while others have many episodes."
Bipolar disorder and driving
"If you have bipolar disorder, you must inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) as it may affect your driving."
Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), or body dysmorphia, is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance."
These flaws are often unnoticeable to others.
"People of any age can have BDD, but it's most common in teenagers and young adults."
It affects both men and women.
Having BDD does not mean you're vain or self-obsessed.
It can be very upsetting and have a big impact on your life.
Symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
You might have body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) if you:
""
worry a lot about a specific area of your body (particularly your face)
spend a lot of time comparing your looks with other people's
look at yourself in mirrors a lot or avoid mirrors altogether
"go to a lot of effort to conceal flaws – for example, by spending a long time combing your hair, applying make-up or choosing clothes"
"pick at your skin to make it ""smooth"""
"BDD can seriously affect your daily life, including your work, social life and relationships."
"BDD can also lead to depression, self-harm and even thoughts of suicide."
Getting help for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
You should see a GP if you think you might have BDD.
They'll probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect your life.
They may also ask if you've had any thoughts about harming yourself.
"You may be treated by the GP, or they may refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment."
"It can be very difficult to seek help for BDD, but it's important to remember that you have nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about."
Getting help is important because your symptoms probably will not go away without treatment and may get worse.
You can also refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.

Treatments for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
The symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can get better with treatment.
"If your symptoms are relatively mild, you should be referred for a type of talking therapy called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which you have either on your own or in a group."
"If you have moderate symptoms, you should be offered either CBT or a type of antidepressant medicine called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)."
"If your symptoms are more severe, or other treatments do not work, you should be offered CBT together with an SSRI."
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
CBT can help you manage your BDD symptoms by changing the way you think and behave.
"It helps you learn what triggers your symptoms, and teaches you different ways of thinking about and dealing with your habits."
You and your therapist will agree on goals for the therapy and work together to try to reach them.
CBT for treating BDD will usually include a technique known as exposure and response prevention (ERP).
This involves gradually facing situations that would normally make you think obsessively about your appearance and feel anxious.
"Your therapist will help you to find other ways of dealing with your feelings in these situations so that, over time, you become able to deal with them without feeling self-conscious or afraid."
"You may also be given some self-help information to read at home and your CBT might involve group work, depending on your symptoms."
CBT for children and young people will usually also involve their family members or carers.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
SSRIs are a type of antidepressant.
"There are a number of different SSRIs, but fluoxetine is most commonly used to treat BDD."
It may take up to 12 weeks for SSRIs to have an effect on your BDD symptoms.
"If they work for you, you'll probably be asked to keep taking them for several months to improve your symptoms further and stop them coming back."
"There are some common side effects of taking SSRIs, but these will often pass within a few weeks."
Your doctor will keep a close eye on you over the first few weeks.
"It's important to tell them if you're feeling particularly anxious or emotional, or are having thoughts of harming yourself."
"If you've not had symptoms for 6 to 12 months, you'll probably be taken off SSRIs."
"This will be done by slowly reducing your dose over time to help make sure your symptoms do not come back (relapse) and to avoid any side effects of coming off the drug (withdrawal symptoms), such as anxiety."
"Children, adults younger than 30, and all people with a history of suicidal behaviour will need to be carefully monitored when taking SSRIs."
This is because they may have a higher chance of developing suicidal thoughts or trying to hurt themselves in the early stages of treatment.
Children and young people may be offered an SSRI if they're having severe symptoms of BDD.
Medicine should only be suggested after they have seen a psychiatrist and been offered talking therapies.
Further treatment
"If treatment with both CBT and an SSRI has not improved your BDD symptoms after 12 weeks, you may be prescribed a different type of SSRI or another antidepressant called clomipramine."
"If you do not see any improvements in your symptoms, you may be referred to a mental health clinic or hospital that specialises in BDD, such as the National OCD/BDD Service in London."
These services will probably do a more in-depth assessment of your BDD.
"They may offer you more CBT or a different kind of therapy, as well as a different kind of antidepressant."
Causes of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
"It's not known exactly what causes body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), but it might be associated with:"
""
"genetics – you may be more likely to develop BDD if you have a relative with BDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or depression"
a chemical imbalance in the brain
"a traumatic experience in the past – you may be more likely to develop BDD if you were teased, bullied or abused when you were a child"
"Some people with BDD also have another mental health condition, such as obsessive compulsive behaviour (OCD), generalised anxiety disorder or an eating disorder."
Things you can do to help with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
Support groups for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)
"Some people may find it helpful to contact or join a support group for information, advice and practical tips on coping with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)."
"You can ask your doctor if there are any groups in your area, and the BDD Foundation has a directory of local and online BDD support groups."
You may also find the following organisations to be useful sources of information and advice:

Overview - Borderline personality disorder
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others.
It's the most commonly recognised personality disorder.
"In general, someone with a personality disorder will differ significantly from an average person in terms of how he or she thinks, perceives, feels or relates to others."
Symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD)
The symptoms of BPD can be grouped into 4 main areas:
""
emotional instability – the psychological term for this is affective dysregulation
disturbed patterns of thinking or perception – cognitive distortions or perceptual distortions
impulsive behaviour
intense but unstable relationships with others
"The symptoms of a personality disorder may range from mild to severe and usually emerge in adolescence, persisting into adulthood."
Causes of borderline personality disorder (BPD)
The causes of BPD are unclear.
BPD appears to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
"People with BPD come from many different backgrounds, but most will have experienced some kind of trauma or neglect as children."
When to get medical advice
"If you're experiencing symptoms of BPD, make an appointment with a GP."
They may ask about:
""
how you feel
your recent behaviour
what sort of impact your symptoms have had on your quality of life
"This is to rule out other more common mental health conditions, such as depression, and to make sure there's no immediate risk to your health and wellbeing."
You may also find Mind a useful website.
Find out more about how BPD is diagnosed
""
Treating borderline personality disorder (BPD)
Many people with BPD can benefit from psychological or medical treatment.
Treatment may involve a range of individual and group psychological therapies (psychotherapy) carried out by trained professionals working with a community mental health team (CMHT).
Effective treatment may last more than a year.
"Over time, many people with BPD overcome their symptoms and recover."
Additional treatment is recommended for people whose symptoms return.
Associated mental health problems
"Many people with BPD also have another mental health condition or behavioural problem, such as:"
""
misusing alcohol
generalised anxiety disorder
bipolar disorder
depression
misusing drugs
"an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia"
"another personality disorder, such as antisocial personality disorder"
"BPD can be a serious condition, and many people with the condition self-harm and attempt suicide."
Overview - Bulimia
Bulimia is an eating disorder and mental health condition.
People who have bulimia go through periods where they eat a lot of food in a very short amount of time (binge eating) and then purge the food from their body to try to stop themselves gaining weight.
"Purging could include making themselves vomit, using laxatives (medicine to help them poo) or diuretics (medicine that makes you pee more), fasting or doing excessive exercise, or a combination of these."
"Anyone can get bulimia, but it is more common in young people aged 15 to 25."
Symptoms of bulimia
Symptoms of bulimia include:
""
"eating very large amounts of food in a short time, often in an out-of-control way – this is called binge eating"
"making yourself vomit, using laxatives or diuretics, fasting, or doing an extreme amount of exercise after a binge to avoid putting on weight – this is called purging"
fear of putting on weight
being very critical about your weight and body shape
"mood changes – for example, feeling very tense or anxious"
These symptoms may not be easy to spot in someone else because bulimia can make people behave very secretively.

Getting help for bulimia
Getting help and support as soon as possible gives you the best chance of recovering from bulimia.
"If you think you may have bulimia, see a GP as soon as you can."
"They'll ask you questions about your eating habits and how you're feeling, and will check your overall health and weight."
"If they think you may have bulimia or another eating disorder, they should refer you to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists."
It can be very hard to admit you have a problem and ask for help.
It may make things easier if you bring a friend or loved one with you to your appointment.
You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from the eating disorders charity Beat by calling their helpline on 0808 801 0677.

Read more about talking to your child about eating disorders and supporting someone with an eating disorder.
Treatment for bulimia
"You can recover from bulimia, but it may take time and recovery will be different for everyone."
"Your treatment plan will be tailored to you and should take into account any other support you might need, such as for depression or anxiety."
"If you're over 18, you'll probably be offered a guided self-help programme."
"This involves working through a self-help book or online programme, and often includes keeping a diary and making a plan for your meals."
You'll be supported by a therapist during this process.
You may also be offered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
"If you're under 18, you may be offered family therapy or CBT."
This may be offered through your local children and young people's mental health services.
Read more about treatments for bulimia
""
Health risks of bulimia
"Bulimia can eventually lead to physical problems associated with not getting the right nutrients, vomiting a lot, or overusing laxatives."
Possible complications include:
""
feeling tired and weak
dental problems – stomach acid from persistent vomiting can damage tooth enamel
"bad breath, a sore throat, or even tears in the lining of the throat – also caused by stomach acid"
irregular or absent periods
dry skin and hair
brittle fingernails
swollen glands
fits and muscle spasms
"heart, kidney or bowel problems, including constipation"
bone problems – you may be more likely to develop problems such as low bone density (osteopenia) particularly if you have had symptoms of both bulimia and anorexia
Causes of bulimia
We do not know exactly what causes bulimia and other eating disorders.
You may be more likely to get an eating disorder if:
""
"you or a member of your family has a history of eating disorders, depression, or alcohol or drug addiction"
"you have been criticised for your eating habits, body shape or weight"
"you're overly concerned with being slim, particularly if you also feel pressure from society or your job"
"you have anxiety, low self-esteem or an obsessive personality"
"you've experienced a stressful event or trauma, such as physical or sexual abuse"
Binge-purge cycle
"Bulimia is often a vicious cycle of binging and purging, triggered by things such as hunger, sadness or stress."
Periods of excessive eating and loss of control (binge eating) may be used as a way of coping with difficult emotions.
You may then feel guilty or ashamed.
"You then purge to get rid of the calories, leaving you feeling hungry again, and the cycle continues."
"You may set very strict rules for yourself about dieting, eating or exercising."
Claustrophobia
Claustrophobia is the irrational fear of confined spaces.
"People affected by claustrophobia will often go out of their way to avoid confined spaces, such as lifts, tunnels, tube trains and public toilets."
But avoiding these places may reinforce the fear.
"Some people with claustrophobia experience mild anxiety when in a confined space, while others have severe anxiety or a panic attack."
It's estimated around 10% of the UK population are affected by claustrophobia during their lifetime.
Triggers of claustrophobia
Many different situations or feelings can trigger claustrophobia.
Even thinking about certain situations without exposure to them could be a trigger.
Common triggers of claustrophobia include:
""
lifts
tunnels
tube trains
public toilets
rooms where the doors have to be locked
cars
hotel rooms with sealed windows
planes
"If you have felt anxious in the last 6 months about being in a confined space or crowded place, or you have avoided these situations for this reason, it's likely that you're affected by claustrophobia."
MRI scan anxiety
"If you have claustrophobia and need to have an MRI scan, let the staff at the hospital know before the day of your appointment."
You can talk to your consultant about having a sedative to help you relax.
You should do this well in advance of having the scan.
"In some cases, you may be able to attend an open or upright MRI centre, designed for people with severe MRI anxiety."
But these clinics are often only available privately.
Symptoms of claustrophobia
People with claustrophobia can have panic attacks.
They can be very frightening and distressing.
"As well as overwhelming feelings of anxiety, claustrophobia can also cause physical symptoms, such as:"
""
sweating
trembling
hot flushes or chills
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
a choking sensation
a rapid heartbeat (tachycardia)
chest pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest
a sensation of butterflies in the stomach
feeling sick
headaches and dizziness
feeling faint
numbness or pins and needles
a dry mouth
a need to go to the toilet
ringing in your ears
feeling confused or disorientated
"If you have severe claustrophobia, you may also experience psychological symptoms, such as:"
""
fear of losing control
fear of fainting
feelings of being detached from your body
fear of dying
What causes claustrophobia?
Claustrophobia is often caused by a traumatic event experienced during early childhood.
"For example, adults may develop claustrophobia if, as a child, they:"
""
were trapped or kept in a confined space
were bullied or abused
had a parent with claustrophobia
"Claustrophobia can also be triggered by unpleasant experiences or situations, such as turbulence when flying or being stuck in a tube tunnel between stations."
A child growing up with a parent who has claustrophobia may develop claustrophobia themselves by associating confined spaces with their parent's anxiety and feeling helpless to comfort the person they loved.
Treating claustrophobia
Many people live with claustrophobia without having it formally diagnosed and take great care to avoid confined spaces.
"But getting help from a GP or a specialist with expertise in behavioural therapy, such as a psychologist, can often be beneficial."
Treatments are available for claustrophobia and can include:
""
"talking treatments, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and exposure therapy"
self-help - find out more about phobias and self-care on the Mind website
"medicines, such as antidepressants or tranquilisers"
"CBT is a talking therapy that explores your thoughts, feelings and behaviour, and develops practical ways of effectively dealing with your phobia."

You can do it by yourself or with the help of a professional.
Find out more about CBT and exposure therapy.
Coping with a panic attack
"If possible, stay where you are during a panic attack."
"It could last up to an hour, so if you're driving, you may need to pull over and park where it's safe to do so."
Do not rush to a place of safety.
"During the attack, remind yourself that the frightening thoughts and sensations are a sign of panic and will eventually pass."
"Focus on something non-threatening and visible, such as the time passing on your watch or items in a supermarket."
"The symptoms of a panic attack usually peak within 10 minutes, with most attacks lasting between 5 and 30 minutes."

Cyclothymia
"Cyclothymia, or cyclothymic disorder, causes mood changes – from feeling low to emotional highs."
Cyclothymia is a mild form of bipolar disorder.
"Most people's symptoms are mild enough that they do not seek mental health treatment, or the emotional highs feel nice, so they do not realise there's anything wrong or want to seek help."
This means cyclothymia often goes undiagnosed and untreated.
"But the mood swings can affect daily life, and cause problems with personal and work relationships."
"If you think you have cyclothymia, it's important to seek help from a GP."
"People with cyclothymia are at risk of developing full bipolar disorder, so it's important to get help before reaching this stage."
People can get cyclothymia at any age.
Symptoms of cyclothymia
"If you have cyclothymia, you'll have periods of feeling low followed by periods of feeling very happy and excited (called hypomania) when you do not need much sleep, are more sociable and impulsive and feel that you have a lot of energy."
The periods of low mood do not last long enough and are not severe enough to be diagnosed as depression.
"You might feel sluggish and lose interest in things during these periods, but this should not stop you going about your day-to-day life."
Mood swings will be fairly frequent – you will not go for longer than 2 months without experiencing low mood or an emotional high.
"Doctors may diagnose cyclothymia if you've had symptoms for at least 2 years, or 1 year for children and teenagers."
"Symptoms of cyclothymia are not severe enough for you to be diagnosed with full bipolar disorder, and your mood swings will be broken up by periods of normal mood."
Treatment for cyclothymia
Treatment usually involves some kind of talking therapy (psychotherapy).
You may also need medicines.
The aim is to:
""
stop the cyclothymia developing into full bipolar disorder
reduce your symptoms
stop your symptoms coming back
Psychotherapy
"Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), may help with cyclothymia."
CBT involves talking to a trained therapist to find ways to help you manage your symptoms by changing the way you think and behave.
You'll be given practical ways to improve your state of mind on a daily basis.
Medicines
You may be prescribed medicines to level out your mood (mood stabilisers).
Mood stabilisers include:
""
lithium – commonly used to treat bipolar disorder
"epilepsy medicines – such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or sodium valproate"
Some antipsychotics such as quetiapine are also sometimes used as mood stabilisers.
But not all people with cyclothymia need or respond to medicine.
The charity Mind has more information on lithium and other mood stabilisers.

You may also find it helpful to join a support group so you can talk to others who share your experiences and problems.

Living with cyclothymia
It's not known how many people with cyclothymia will go on to develop full bipolar disorder.
But some people with cyclothymia see their elevated or depressed moods become more severe.
Other people will find their cyclothymia continues and they need to manage this as a lifelong condition.
Causes of cyclothymia
"The causes of cyclothymia are not known, but there's probably a genetic link because cyclothymia, depression and bipolar disorder all tend to run in families."
"In some people, traumatic events or experiences may act as a trigger for the condition, such as severe illness or long periods of stress."
Overview - Depression in adults
Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days.
"Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days."
Some people think depression is trivial and not a genuine health condition.
They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms.
"Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can ""snap out of"" by ""pulling yourself together""."
"The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery."
These pages are about depression in adults.
Read about depression in children and young people.
How to tell if you have depression
Depression affects people in different ways and can cause a wide variety of symptoms.
"They range from lasting feelings of unhappiness and hopelessness, to losing interest in the things you used to enjoy and feeling very tearful."
Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety.
"There can be physical symptoms too, such as feeling constantly tired, sleeping badly, having no appetite or sex drive, and various aches and pains."
The symptoms of depression range from mild to severe.
"At its mildest, you may simply feel persistently low in spirit, while severe depression can make you feel suicidal, that life is no longer worth living."
"Most people experience feelings of stress, anxiety or low mood during difficult times."
"A low mood may improve after a short period of time, rather than being a sign of depression."
When to see a doctor
It's important to seek help from a GP if you think you may be depressed.
"Many people wait a long time before seeking help for depression, but it's best not to delay."
"The sooner you see a doctor, the sooner you can be on the way to recovery."
What causes depression?
Sometimes there's a trigger for depression.
"Life-changing events, such as bereavement, losing your job or giving birth, can bring it on."
People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves.
But you can also become depressed for no obvious reason.

Treating depression
"Treatment for depression can involve a combination of lifestyle changes, talking therapies and medicine."
Your recommended treatment will be based on how severe your depression is.
"If you have mild depression, your doctor may suggest waiting to see whether it improves on its own, while monitoring your progress."
"This is known as ""watchful waiting""."
They may also suggest lifestyle measures such as exercise and guided self-help.
"Talking therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), may also be used for mild depression."
"For moderate to severe depression, a combination of talking therapy and antidepressants is often recommended."
"If you have severe depression, you may be referred to a specialist mental health team for intensive specialist talking treatments and prescribed medicine."
Living with depression
"Many people with depression benefit by making lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, cutting down on alcohol, giving up smoking and eating healthily."
Reading a self-help book or joining a support group are also worthwhile.
They can help you gain a better understanding about what causes you to feel depressed.
Sharing your experiences with others in a similar situation can also be very supportive.
Dissociative disorders are a range of conditions that can cause physical and psychological problems.
"Some dissociative disorders are very short-lived, perhaps following a traumatic life event, and resolve on their own over a matter of weeks or months."
Others can last much longer.
Symptoms of a dissociative disorder
Symptoms of dissociative disorder can vary but may include:
""
feeling disconnected from yourself and the world around you
"forgetting about certain time periods, events and personal information"
feeling uncertain about who you are
having multiple distinct identities
feeling little or no physical pain
Some people with dissociative disorders have seizures.
These can vary from fainting to something more like an epileptic seizure.
Dissociation is a way the mind copes with too much stress.
Periods of dissociation can last for a relatively short time (hours or days) or for much longer (weeks or months).
Many people with a dissociative disorder have had a traumatic event during childhood.
Dissociation can happen as a way of coping with it.
Types of dissociative disorder
There are several different types of dissociative disorder.
The 3 main types are:
""
depersonalisation-derealisation disorder
dissociative amnesia
dissociative identity disorder
Depersonalisation-derealisation disorder
"Depersonalisation is where you have the feeling of being outside yourself and observing your actions, feelings or thoughts from a distance."
Derealisation is where you feel the world is unreal.
"People and things around you may seem ""lifeless"" or ""foggy""."
"You can have depersonalisation or derealisation, or both together."
It may last only a few moments or come and go over many years.
Dissociative amnesia
Someone with dissociative amnesia will have periods where they cannot remember information about themselves or events in their past life.
They may also forget a learned talent or skill.
These gaps in memory are much more severe than normal forgetfulness and are not the result of another medical condition.
Some people with dissociative amnesia find themselves in a strange place without knowing how they got there.
"They may have travelled there on purpose, or wandered in a confused state."
"These blank episodes may last minutes, hours or days."
"In rare cases, they can last months or years."
Dissociative identity disorder
Dissociative identity disorder (DID) used to be called multiple personality disorder.
Someone diagnosed with DID may feel uncertain about their identity and who they are.
"They may feel the presence of other identities, each with their own names, voices, personal histories and mannerisms."
The main symptoms of DID are:
""
memory gaps about everyday events and personal information
having several distinct identities
Associated conditions
"Someone with a dissociative disorder may also have other mental health conditions, such as:"
""
medically unexplained symptoms
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
depression
mood swings
anxiety and panic attacks
suicidal tendencies or self-harm
an eating disorder
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
They may also have problems sleeping (insomnia).
Causes of dissociative disorder
"There are many possible causes of dissociative disorders, including previous traumatic experience."
"Someone with a dissociative disorder may have experienced physical, sexual or emotional abuse during childhood."
"Some people dissociate after experiencing war, kidnapping or even an invasive medical procedure."
Switching off from reality is a normal defence mechanism that helps the person cope during a traumatic time.
"It's a form of denial, as if ""this is not happening to me""."
"It becomes a problem when the environment is no longer traumatic but the person still acts and lives as if it is, and has not dealt with or processed the event."
Diagnosing dissociative disorders
A GP may examine you and do some tests to check if another illness might be the cause of your symptoms.
They may also refer you to a mental health specialist for a full assessment.
Assessment
The specialist who carries out your assessment should have a good understanding of dissociative disorders.
"The assessment may include questions about your thoughts, feelings, behaviour and your symptoms."
"It's important to be honest about your symptoms and not to feel ashamed or embarrassed, so you can receive the help and support you need."
Treatments for dissociative disorders
Many people with a dissociative disorder make a full recovery with treatment and support.
Talking therapies
Talking therapies are often recommended for dissociative disorders.
"The aim of talking therapies such as counselling or psychotherapy is to help you cope with the underlying cause of your symptoms, and to learn and practise techniques to manage the periods of feeling disconnected."
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR)
Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychological treatment that can help reduce the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
It is sometimes used to treat dissociative disorders.
Medicines
"There's no specific medicine to treat dissociation, but medicines like antidepressants may be prescribed to treat associated conditions like depression, anxiety and panic attacks."
If you're feeling suicidal
"If you have thoughts about taking your life, it's important you ask someone for help."
"It's probably difficult for you to see it at this time, but you're not alone or beyond help."
There are people you can talk to who want to help:
""
"speak to a friend, family member or someone you trust, as they may be able to help you calm down and find some breathing space"
call the Samaritans free 24-hour support service on 116 123
go to your nearest A&E and tell the staff how you're feeling
contact NHS 111
make an urgent appointment to see a GP

""
What to do if you're worried about someone
"If you're worried that someone you know may be considering suicide, try to encourage them to talk about how they're feeling."
Listening is the best way to help.
Try to avoid offering solutions and try not to judge.
"If they have previously been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as depression, you can speak to a member of their care team."
They will offer help and advice but cannot share information about the person without consent.
Further help and support
"If you have a dissociative disorder, getting help and support is an important part of the recovery process."
"Talking to your partner, family and friends about your experience of dissociative disorder can help them understand how you feel."
Mental health charity Mind has more information on dissociative disorders and a list of support organisations.
Reading about other people with similar experiences may also help.

An eating disorder is a mental health condition where you use the control of food to cope with feelings and other situations.
Unhealthy eating behaviours may include eating too much or too little or worrying about your weight or body shape.
"Anyone can get an eating disorder, but teenagers and young adults are mostly affected."
"With treatment, most people can recover from an eating disorder."
Types of eating disorders
The most common eating disorders are:
""
"anorexia nervosa (often called anorexia) – trying to control your weight by not eating enough food, exercising too much, or doing both"
bulimia – losing control over how much you eat and then taking drastic action to not put on weight
binge eating disorder (BED) – eating large portions of food until you feel uncomfortably full
Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED)
A person may have an OSFED if their symptoms do not exactly fit the expected symptoms for any specific eating disorders.
OSFED is the most common eating disorder.
Find out more about OSFED on the Beat website
""
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID)
"ARFID is when someone avoids certain foods, limits how much they eat or does both."
Beliefs about weight or body shape are not reasons why people develop ARFID.
Possible reasons for ARFID include:
""
"negative feelings over the smell, taste or texture of certain foods"
"a response to a past experience with food that was upsetting, for example, choking or being sick after eating something"
not feeling hungry or just a lack of interest in eating
Find out more about ARFID on the Beat website
""
Check if you have an eating disorder
"If you or people around you are worried that you have an unhealthy relationship with food, you could have an eating disorder."
Symptoms of eating disorders include:
""
spending a lot of time worrying about your weight and body shape
avoiding socialising when you think food will be involved
eating very little food
making yourself sick or taking laxatives after you eat
exercising too much
having very strict habits or routines around food
"changes in your mood, such as being withdrawn, anxious or depressed"
"You may also notice physical signs, including:"
""
"feeling cold, tired or dizzy"
"pains, tingling or numbness in your arms and legs (poor circulation)"
"feeling your heart racing, fainting or feeling faint"
"problems with your digestion, such as bloating, constipation or diarrhoea"
your weight being very high or very low for someone of your age and height
not getting your period or other delayed signs of puberty

Warning signs of an eating disorder in someone else
It can be very difficult to identify that a loved one or friend has an eating disorder.
Warning signs to look out for include:
""
dramatic weight loss
"lying about how much they've eaten, when they've eaten, or their weight"
eating a lot of food very fast
going to the bathroom a lot after eating
exercising a lot
avoiding eating with others
cutting food into small pieces or eating very slowly
wearing loose or baggy clothes to hide their weight loss
Getting help for an eating disorder
"If you think you may have an eating disorder, see a GP as soon as you can."
"A GP will ask about your eating habits and how you're feeling, plus check your overall health and weight."
They may refer you to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists.
It can be very hard to admit you have a problem and ask for help.
It may make things easier if you bring a friend or loved one with you to your appointment.
You can also talk in confidence to an adviser from eating disorders charity Beat by calling the Beat helpline on 0808 801 0677.

Treatment for eating disorders
"You can recover from an eating disorder, but it may take time and recovery will be different for everyone."
"If you're referred to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists, they'll be responsible for your care."
"They should talk to you about the support you might need, such as for other conditions you have, and include this in your treatment plan."
"Your treatment will depend on the type of eating disorder you have, but usually includes a talking therapy."
You may also need regular health checks if your eating disorder is having an impact on your physical health.
Your treatment may also involve working through a guided self-help programme if you have bulimia or binge eating disorder.
"Most people will be offered individual therapy, but those with binge eating disorder may be offered group therapy."
Read more about the different treatments for:
""
anorexia
bulimia
binge eating disorder
Treatment for other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) will depend on the type of eating disorder your symptoms are most like.
"For example, if your symptoms are most like anorexia, your treatment will be similar to the treatment for anorexia."
What causes eating disorders?
The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown.
You may be more likely to get an eating disorder if:
""
"you or a member of your family has a history of eating disorders, depression, or alcohol or drug misuse"
"you've been criticised for your eating habits, body shape or weight"
"you're really worried about being slim, particularly if you also feel pressure from society or your job, for example, ballet dancers, models or athletes"
"you have anxiety, low self-esteem, an obsessive personality or are a perfectionist"
you've been sexually abused
Fabricated or induced illness (FII) is a rare form of child abuse.
It happens when a parent or carer exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in the child.
"The parent or carer tries to convince doctors that the child is ill, or that their condition is worse than it really is."
"The parent or carer does not necessarily intend to deceive doctors, but their behaviour is likely to harm the child."
"For example the child may have unnecessary treatment or tests, be made to believe they're ill, or have their education disrupted."
"FII used to be known as ""Munchausen's syndrome by proxy"" (not to be confused with Munchausen's syndrome, where a person pretends to be ill or causes illness or injury to themselves)."
Signs of fabricated or induced illness
Fabricated or induced illness (FII) covers a wide range of symptoms and behaviours involving parents or carers seeking healthcare for a child.
"This ranges from exaggerating or inventing symptoms, to deliberately making the child ill."
""
Behaviours in FII can include a parent or carer who:
""
persuades healthcare professionals that their child is ill when they're healthy
exaggerates or lies about their child's symptoms
"manipulates test results to suggest the child is ill, for example, by putting glucose in urine samples to suggest the child has diabetes"
"deliberately induces symptoms of illness, for example, by poisoning their child with unnecessary medicine or other substances"
Cases where the parent or carer wrongly reports symptoms are much more common than cases where they induce illness in the child.
Learn more about the signs of fabricated or induced illness.
Why fabricated or induced illness happens
The reasons why FII happens are not fully understood.
"The parent or carer will have a need for their child to be treated as if they're ill, or as being more unwell than they really are."
Their behaviour is intended to convince doctors that the child is ill.
"This may be because the parent or carer gains something, such as attention, support or closeness to the child."
"Or it may be because they have anxiety or incorrect beliefs about their child's health, and they need these beliefs to be confirmed and acted upon."
The parent or carer is not always fully aware of the reasons for their own behaviour.
"A large number of parents or carers involved in FII have borderline personality disorders characterised by emotional instability, impulsiveness and disturbed thinking."
"Some parents or carers involved in FII have so-called ""somatoform disorders"", where they experience multiple, recurrent physical symptoms."
A proportion of these parents or carers also have Munchausen's syndrome.
"Some parents or carers have unresolved psychological and behavioural problems, such as a history of self-harming, or drug or alcohol misuse."
Some have experienced the death of another child.
There have also been several reported cases where illness was fabricated or induced for financial reasons.
"For example, to claim disability benefits."
Read more about the possible causes of fabricated or induced illness.
What to do if you suspect a child is at risk
FII is a child safeguarding issue and cannot be managed by the NHS alone.
"Medical professionals who suspect FII is happening should liaise with social services and the police, and must follow local child safeguarding procedures."
"If your job involves working with children, for example, if you're a nursery worker or teacher, tell the person in your organisation who's responsible for child safeguarding issues."
"If you do not know who this is, your immediate supervisor or manager should be able to tell you."
"If you suspect someone you know may be fabricating or inducing illness in their child, do not confront them directly."
"It's unlikely to make the person admit to wrongdoing, and it may give them the opportunity to dispose of any evidence of abuse."
"You can contact your local social services department, or telephone the NSPCC's child protection helpline on 0808 800 5000, or email the NSPCC at help@NSPCC.org.uk."
The helpline is open from 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday.
Read more about what to do if you suspect fabricated or induced illness.
How a case is managed
The child
"The first priority is to protect the child, find out their true state of health and restore them to good health."
Health professionals will create a health and education rehabilitation plan for the child.
The local authority children's social care team may also be involved.
They may remove the child from the care of the person responsible.
"If the child is in hospital, the parent or carer may need to be removed from the ward."
"The child may need help returning to a normal lifestyle, including going back to school."
Younger children and babies who do not understand what was happening often make a good recovery after the abuse stops.
"Older children, particularly those who've been abused for many years, may have more problems."
"For example, many affected children believe they're really ill."
They need help and support to develop a more realistic understanding of their health.
"It's common for older children to feel loyal to their parent or carer, and a sense of guilt if that person is removed from the family."
The parent or carer
"Once the child is safe, it may be possible to treat the parent or carer's underlying psychological problems."
This may include a combination of:
""
intensive psychotherapy
family therapy
The aim of psychotherapy is to uncover and resolve the issues that caused the person to fabricate or induce illness in the child.
"Family therapy aims to resolve any tensions within the family, improve parenting skills and attempt to repair the relationship between the parent or carer and the child."
"In more severe cases, the parent or carer may be compulsorily detained in a psychiatric ward under the Mental Health Act so their relationship with the child can be closely monitored."
Parents or carers involved in FII are difficult to treat because most do not admit their deceptions and refuse to recognise their abusive behaviour.
"In some cases, the child is permanently removed from their care."
The best results are achieved in cases where the parent or carer:
""
understands and acknowledges the harm they've caused
is able to communicate the underlying motivations and needs that led them to fabricate or cause illness
is able to work together with healthcare and other professionals
"Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe."
Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life.
"For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam, or having a medical test or job interview."
"During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal."
But some people find it hard to control their worries.
Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily lives.
"Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including:"
""
panic disorder
"phobias, such as agoraphobia or claustrophobia"
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
social anxiety disorder (social phobia)
The information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).
"GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than 1 specific event."
People with GAD feel anxious most days and often struggle to remember the last time they felt relaxed.
"As soon as 1 anxious thought is resolved, another may appear about a different issue."
Symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
GAD can cause both psychological (mental) and physical symptoms.
"These vary from person to person, but can include:"
""
feeling restless or worried
having trouble concentrating or sleeping
dizziness or heart palpitations
When to get help for anxiety
"Although feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, see a GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or causing you distress."
"Your GP will ask about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions to find out if you could have GAD."
Find out more about diagnosing GAD
""
What causes generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)?
"The exact cause of GAD is not fully understood, although it's likely that a combination of several factors plays a role."
Research has suggested that these may include:
""
the genes you inherit from your parents
"having a history of stressful or traumatic experiences, such as domestic violence, child abuse or bullying"
"having a painful long-term health condition, such as arthritis"
having a history of drug or alcohol misuse
But many people develop GAD for no apparent reason.
Who's affected
GAD is a common condition.
"More women are affected than men, and the condition is more common in people from the ages of 35 to 55."
How generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is treated
"GAD can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different treatments are available that can ease your symptoms."
These include:
""
talking therapies – you can get talking therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS; you do not need a referral from a GP and you can refer yourself for talking therapies service in your area – read more about how to find an NHS talking therapies service
medication – such as a type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
"With treatment, many people are able to control their anxiety levels."
But some treatments may need to be continued for a long time and there may be periods when your symptoms worsen.
Self-help for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)
"There are also many things you can do yourself to help reduce your anxiety, such as: "
""
going on a self-help course
exercising regularly
stopping smoking
looking after your physical health
"Health anxiety is when you spend so much time worrying you're ill, or going to get ill, that it starts to take over your life."
It's related to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Check if you have health anxiety
You may have health anxiety if you:
""
constantly worry about your health
"frequently check your body for signs of illness, such as lumps, tingling or pain"
are always asking people for reassurance that you're not ill
worry that a doctor or medical tests may have missed something
obsessively look at health information on the internet or in the media
"avoid anything to do with serious illness, such as medical TV programmes"
"act as if you were ill (for example, avoiding physical activities)"
"Anxiety itself can cause symptoms like headaches or a racing heartbeat, and you may mistake these for signs of illness."
Self-help for health anxiety
Keep a diary
"Note how often you check your body, ask people for reassurance, or look at health information."
Try to gradually reduce how often you do these things over a week.
Challenge your thoughts
Draw a table with 2 columns.
"Write your health worries in the 1st column, then more balanced thoughts in the 2nd."
"For example, in the 1st column you may write, ""I'm worried about these headaches"" and in the 2nd, ""Headaches can often be a sign of stress""."
Keep busy with other things
"When you get the urge to check your body, for example, distract yourself by going for a walk or calling a friend."
Get back to normal activities
"Try to gradually start doing things you've been avoiding because of your health worries, such as sports or socialising."
"A hoarding disorder is where someone acquires an excessive number of items and stores them in a chaotic manner, usually resulting in unmanageable amounts of clutter."
The items can be of little or no monetary value.
Hoarding is considered a significant problem if:
""
"the amount of clutter interferes with everyday living – for example, the person is unable to use their kitchen or bathroom and cannot access rooms"
"the clutter is causing significant distress or negatively affecting the quality of life of the person or their family – for example, they become upset if someone tries to clear the clutter and their relationship suffers"
"Hoarding disorders are challenging to treat because many people who hoard frequently do not see it as a problem, or have little awareness of how it's affecting their life or the lives of others."
"Some may realise they have a problem but are reluctant to seek help because they feel extremely ashamed, humiliated or guilty about it."
"It's really important to encourage a person who is hoarding to seek help, as their difficulties discarding objects can not only cause loneliness and mental health problems but also pose a health and safety risk."
"If not tackled, it's a problem that will probably never go away."
Why someone may hoard
The reasons why someone begins hoarding are not fully understood.
It can be a symptom of another condition.
"For example, someone with mobility problems may be physically unable to clear the huge amounts of clutter they have acquired, and people with learning disabilities or people developing dementia may be unable to categorise and dispose of items."
Mental health problems associated with hoarding include:
""
severe depression
"psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia"
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
"In some cases, hoarding is a condition in itself and often associated with self-neglect."
These people are more likely to:
""
live alone
be unmarried
"have had a deprived childhood, with either a lack of material objects or a poor relationship with other members of their family"
have a family history of hoarding
have grown up in a cluttered home and never learned to prioritise and sort items
"Many people who hoard have strongly held beliefs related to acquiring and discarding things, such as: ""I may need this someday"" or ""If I buy this, it will make me happy""."
"Others may be struggling to cope with a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one."
"Attempts to discard things often bring up very strong emotions that can feel overwhelming, so the person hoarding often tends to put off or avoid making decisions about what can be thrown out."
"Often, many of the things kept are of little or no monetary value and may be what most people would consider rubbish."
"The person may keep the items for reasons that are not obvious to other people, such as for sentimental reasons, or feeling the objects appear beautiful or useful."
Most people with a hoarding disorder have a very strong emotional attachment to the objects.
What's the difference between hoarding and collecting?
"Many people collect items such as books or stamps, and this is not considered a problem."
"The difference between a ""hoard"" and a ""collection"" is how these items are organised."
"A collection is usually well ordered, and the items are easily accessible."
"A hoard is usually very disorganised, takes up a lot of room and the items are largely inaccessible."
"For example, someone who collects newspaper reviews may cut out the reviews they want and organise them in a catalogue or scrapbook."
Someone who hoards may keep large stacks of newspapers that clutter their entire house and mean it's not actually possible to read any of the reviews they wanted to keep.
Signs of a hoarding disorder
Someone who has a hoarding disorder may typically:
""
"keep or collect items that may have little or no monetary value, such as junk mail and carrier bags, or items they intend to reuse or repair"
find it hard to categorise or organise items
have difficulty making decisions
"struggle to manage everyday tasks, such as cooking, cleaning and paying bills"
"become extremely attached to items, refusing to let anyone touch or borrow them"
have poor relationships with family or friends
Hoarding can start as early as the teenage years and gets more noticeable with age.
"For many, hoarding becomes more problematic in older age, but the problem is usually well established by this time."
Items people may hoard
"Some people with a hoarding disorder will hoard a range of items, while others may just hoard certain types of objects."
Items that are often hoarded include:
""
newspapers and magazines
books
clothes
"leaflets and letters, including junk mail"
bills and receipts
"containers, including plastic bags and cardboard boxes"
household supplies
"Some people also hoard animals, which they may not be able to look after properly."
"More recently, hoarding of data has become more common."
This is where someone stores huge amounts of electronic data and emails that they're extremely reluctant to delete.
Why hoarding disorders are a problem
A hoarding disorder can be a problem for several reasons.
"It can take over the person's life, making it very difficult for them to get around their house."
"It can cause their work performance, personal hygiene and relationships to suffer."
"The person hoarding is usually reluctant or unable to have visitors or even allow tradesmen in to carry out essential repairs, which can cause isolation and loneliness."
The clutter can pose a health risk to the person and anyone who lives in or visits their house.
"For example, it can:"
""
"make cleaning very difficult, leading to unhygienic conditions and encouraging rodent or insect infestations"
be a fire risk and block exits in the event of a fire
cause trips and falls
"fall over or collapse on people, if kept in large piles"
"The hoarding could also be a sign of an underlying condition, such as OCD, other types of anxiety, depression and dementia."
What you can do if you suspect someone is hoarding
"If you think a family member or someone you know has a hoarding disorder, try to persuade them to come with you to see a GP."
"This may not be easy, as someone who hoards might not think they need help."
Try to be sensitive about the issue and emphasise your concerns for their health and wellbeing.
Reassure them that nobody is going to go into their home and throw everything out.
You're just going to have a chat with the doctor about their hoarding to see what can be done and what support is available to empower them to begin the process of decluttering.
"Your GP may be able to refer you to your local community mental health team, which might have a therapist who's familiar with issues such as OCD and hoarding."
"If you have difficulties accessing therapy, the charity OCD-UK may be able to help."
It's generally not a good idea to get extra storage space or call in the council or environmental health to clear the rubbish away.
This won't solve the problem and the clutter often quickly builds up again.
How hoarding disorders are treated
"It's not easy to treat a hoarding disorder, even when the person is prepared to seek help, but it can be overcome."
The main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
The therapist will help the person to understand what makes it difficult to throw things away and the reasons why the clutter has built up.
This will be combined with practical tasks and a plan to work on.
It's important the person takes responsibility for clearing the clutter from their home.
The therapist will support and encourage this.
Antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders.
If a person is willing to get help then they may feel more comfortable contacting a therapist themselves.
They can refer themselves directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
CBT is a type of talking therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think (cognitive) and act (behaviour).
"It encourages you to talk about how you think about yourself, the world and other people, and how what you do affects your thoughts and feelings."
"Regular sessions of CBT over a long period of time are usually necessary and will almost always need to include some home-based sessions, working directly on the clutter."
"This requires motivation, commitment and patience, as it can take many months to achieve the treatment goal."
"The goal is to improve the person's decision-making and organisational skills, help them overcome urges to save and, ultimately, clear the clutter, room by room."
The therapist won't throw anything away but will help guide and encourage the person to do so.
"The therapist can also help the person develop decision-making strategies, while identifying and challenging underlying beliefs that contribute to the hoarding problem."
"The person gradually becomes better at throwing things away, learning that nothing terrible happens when they do and becomes better at organising items they insist on keeping."
"At the end of treatment, the person may not have cleared all their clutter, but they will have gained a better understanding of their problem."
They will have a plan to help them continue to build on their successes and avoid slipping back into their old ways.
Munchausen syndrome is a psychological condition where someone pretends to be ill or deliberately produces symptoms of illness in themselves.
"Their main intention is to assume the ""sick role"" so that people care for them and they are the centre of attention."
"Any practical benefit in pretending to be sick – for example, claiming incapacity benefit – is not the reason for their behaviour."
"Munchausen syndrome is named after a German aristocrat, Baron Munchausen, who became famous for telling wild, unbelievable tales about his exploits."
Types of behaviour
"People with Munchausen syndrome can behave in a number of different ways, including:"
""
"pretending to have psychological symptoms – for example, claiming to hear voices or claiming to see things that are not really there"
"pretending to have physical symptoms – for example, claiming to have chest pain or a stomach ache"
actively trying to get ill – such as deliberately infecting a wound by rubbing dirt into it
Some people with Munchausen syndrome may spend years travelling from hospital to hospital faking a wide range of illnesses.
"When it's discovered they're lying, they may suddenly leave hospital and move to another area."
"People with Munchausen syndrome can be very manipulative and, in the most serious cases, may undergo painful and sometimes life-threatening surgery, even though they know it's unnecessary."

What causes Munchausen syndrome?
Munchausen syndrome is complex and poorly understood.
"Many people refuse psychiatric treatment or psychological profiling, and it's unclear why people with the syndrome behave the way they do."
Several factors have been identified as possible causes of Munchausen syndrome.
These include:
""
emotional trauma or illness during childhood – this often resulted in extensive medical attention
a personality disorder – a mental health condition that causes patterns of abnormal thinking and behaviour
a grudge against authority figures or healthcare professionals
Childhood trauma
"Munchausen syndrome may be caused by parental neglect and abandonment, or other childhood trauma."
"As a result of this trauma, a person may have unresolved issues with their parents that cause them to fake illness."
They may do this because they:
""
have a compulsion to punish themselves by making themselves ill because they feel unworthy
need to feel important and be the centre of attention
need to pass responsibility for their wellbeing and care on to other people
"There's also some evidence to suggest people who have had extensive medical procedures, or received prolonged medical attention during childhood or their teenage years, are more likely to develop Munchausen syndrome when they're older."
This may be because they associate their childhood memories with a sense of being cared for.
"As they get older, they try to obtain the same feelings of reassurance by pretending to be ill."
Personality disorders
Different personality disorders thought to be linked with Munchausen syndrome include:
""
"antisocial personality disorder – where a person may take pleasure in manipulating and deceiving doctors, giving them a sense of power and control"
borderline personality disorder – where a person struggles to control their feelings and often swings between positive and negative views of others
narcissistic personality disorder – where a person often swings between seeing themselves as special and fearing they're worthless
It could be that the person has an unstable sense of their own identity and also has difficulty forming meaningful relationships with others.
"Playing the ""sick role"" allows them to adopt an identity that brings support and acceptance from others with it."
Admission to hospital also gives the person a clearly defined place in a social network.
Diagnosing Munchausen syndrome
Diagnosing Munchausen syndrome can be challenging for medical professionals.
People with the syndrome are often very convincing and skilled at manipulating and exploiting doctors.
Investigating claims
"If a healthcare professional suspects a person may have Munchausen syndrome, they'll look at the person's health records to check for inconsistencies between their claimed and actual medical history."
Healthcare professionals can also run tests to check for evidence of self-inflicted illness or tampering with clinical tests.
"For example, the person's blood can be checked for traces of medicine they should not be taking but which could explain their symptoms."
"Doctors will also want to rule out other possible motivations for their behaviour, such as faking illness for financial gain or because they want access to strong painkillers."
Munchausen syndrome can usually be diagnosed if:
""
there's clear evidence of fabricating or inducing symptoms
the person's prime motivation is to be seen as sick
there's no other likely reason or explanation for their behaviour
Treating Munchausen syndrome
Treating Munchausen syndrome can be difficult because most people with it refuse to admit they have a problem and refuse to co-operate with treatment plans.
"Some experts recommend that healthcare professionals should adopt a gentle non-confrontational approach, suggesting the person may benefit from a referral to a psychiatrist."
Others argue that a person with Munchausen syndrome should be confronted directly and asked why they've lied and whether they have stress and anxiety.
"People who have Munchausen syndrome have a genuine mental health condition, but will often only admit to having a physical illness."
"If a person admits to their behaviour, they can be referred to a psychiatrist for further treatment."
"If they do not admit to lying, most experts agree the doctor in charge of their care should minimise medical contact with them."
"This is because the doctor-patient relationship is based on trust and if there's evidence the patient can no longer be trusted, the doctor is unable to continue treating them."
Psychiatric treatment and CBT
It may be possible to help control the symptoms of Munchausen syndrome if the person admits they have a problem and co-operates with treatment.
"There's no standard treatment for Munchausen syndrome, but a combination of psychoanalysis and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has shown some success controlling symptoms."
Psychoanalysis is a type of psychotherapy that attempts to uncover and resolve unconscious beliefs and motivations.
CBT helps a person identify unhelpful and unrealistic beliefs and behavioural patterns.
A specially trained therapist teaches the person ways of replacing unrealistic beliefs with more realistic and balanced ones.
Family therapy
People with Munchausen syndrome still in close contact with their family may also benefit from having family therapy.
The person with the syndrome and their close family members discuss how it's affected the family and the positive changes that can be made.
It can also teach family members how to avoid reinforcing the person's abnormal behaviour.
"For example, this could involve recognising when the person is playing the ""sick role"" and avoiding showing them concern or offering support."
Who's affected by Munchausen syndrome?
There appear to be 2 separate groups of people affected by Munchausen syndrome.
They are:
""
"women who are 20 to 40 years of age, often with a background in healthcare"
unmarried white men who are 30 to 50 years of age
It's unclear why these 2 groups tend to be affected by Munchausen syndrome.
Some experts believe Munchausen syndrome is underdiagnosed because many people succeed in deceiving medical staff.
It's also possible cases may be over diagnosed as the same person could use different identities.
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.
"OCD can affect men, women and children."
"People can start having symptoms from as early as 6 years old, but it often begins around puberty and early adulthood."
"OCD can be distressing and significantly interfere with your life, but treatment can help you keep it under control."
Symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
"If you have OCD, you'll usually experience frequent obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours."
"An obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters your mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease."
A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that you feel you need to do to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought.
"For example, someone with an obsessive fear of being burgled may feel they need to check all the windows and doors are locked several times before they can leave their house."
Women can sometimes have OCD during pregnancy or after their baby is born.
Obsessions may include worrying about harming the baby or not sterilising feeding bottles properly.
"Compulsions could be things such as repeatedly checking the baby is breathing, and intrusive, unwanted and unpleasant thoughts, images or urges."
These can cause anxiety and lead to repetitive behaviours.
"If you keep getting these thoughts and they have an effect on your daily life, speak to your GP or health visitor."
They can support you or refer you to a specialist mental health team if you need it.
Getting help for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
People with OCD are sometimes reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed or embarrassed.
"OCD is a health condition like any other, so there's nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about."
"Having OCD does not mean you're ""mad"" and it's not your fault you have it."
There are 2 main ways to get help:
""
refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service – find an NHS talking therapies service in your area
see a GP – they'll ask about your symptoms and can refer you to a local talking therapies service if necessary
"If you think a friend or family member may have OCD, try talking to them about your concerns and suggest they get help."
"If you’re under 18, or want to get help for someone under 18, find out how to get mental health support for children and young people."
It's unlikely OCD will get better without proper treatment and support.
Treatments for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
There are some effective treatments for OCD that can help reduce the impact it has on your life.
The main treatments are:
""
"talking therapy – usually cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which helps you face your fears and obsessive thoughts without ""putting them right"" through compulsions"
"medicine – usually a type of antidepressant medicine called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which can help by altering the balance of chemicals in your brain"
CBT will usually have an effect quite quickly.
"It can take up to 12 weeks before you notice the effects of treatment with SSRIs, but most people will eventually benefit."
"If these treatments do not help, you may be offered:"
""
an alternative SSRI
a combination of an SSRI and CBT
an antidepressant called clomipramine
Some people may be referred to a specialist mental health service for further treatment.
Causes of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
It's not clear what causes OCD.
"A number of different factors may play a part, including:"
""
family history – you're more likely to develop OCD if a family member has it.
"It may be learned behaviour, or possibly because of your genes"
differences in the brain – some people with OCD have areas of unusually high activity in their brain or low levels of a chemical called serotonin
"life events – OCD may be more common in people who have been bullied, abused or neglected, and it sometimes starts after an important life event, such as childbirth or a bereavement"
"personality – neat, meticulous, methodical people with high personal standards may be more likely to develop OCD, also people who are generally quite anxious or have a very strong sense of responsibility for themselves and others."
Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder where you regularly have sudden attacks of panic or fear.
Everyone experiences feelings of anxiety and panic at certain times.
It's a natural response to stressful or dangerous situations.
"But someone with panic disorder has feelings of anxiety, stress and panic regularly and at any time, often for no apparent reason."
Symptoms of panic disorder
Anxiety
Anxiety is a feeling of unease.
"It can range from mild to severe, and can include feelings of worry and fear."
Panic is the most severe form of anxiety.
You may start to avoid certain situations because you fear they'll trigger another attack.
"This can create a cycle of living ""in fear of fear""."
It can add to your sense of panic and may cause you to have more attacks.
Panic attacks
During a panic attack you get a rush of intense mental and physical symptoms.
It can come on very quickly and for no apparent reason.
A panic attack can be very frightening and distressing.
Symptoms include:
""
a racing heartbeat
feeling faint
sweating
nausea
chest pain
shortness of breath
trembling
hot flushes
chills
shaky limbs
a choking sensation
dizziness
numbness or pins and needles
dry mouth
a feeling of dread or a fear of dying
a churning stomach
a tingling in your fingers
feeling like you're not connected to your body
Most panic attacks last between 5 and 20 minutes.
Some have been reported to last up to an hour.
The number of attacks you have will depend on how severe your condition is.
"Some people have attacks once or twice a month, while others have them several times a week."
"Although panic attacks are frightening, they're not dangerous."
"An attack will not cause you any physical harm, and it's unlikely you'll be admitted to hospital if you have one."
"Be aware that most of these symptoms can also be symptoms of other conditions or problems, so you may not always be experiencing a panic attack."
"For example, you may have a racing heartbeat if you have very low blood pressure."
When to get help
See a GP if you've been experiencing symptoms of panic disorder.
"They'll ask you to describe your symptoms, how often you get them, and how long you have had them."
They may also carry out a physical examination to rule out other conditions that could be causing your symptoms.
"It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed."
You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you have regular and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least a month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.
Treatments for panic disorder
Treatment aims to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease your symptoms.
Talking therapies and medicine are the main treatments for panic disorder.
Your treatment will depend on your symptoms.
Talking therapies
You can refer yourself directly to a talking therapies service for treatment based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).
Find a talking therapies service (England only)
"If you prefer, you can see a GP and they can refer you."
Your therapist may discuss with you how you react when you have a panic attack and what you think about.
They can teach you ways of changing your behaviour to help you keep calm during an attack.
You may need to see your GP regularly while you're having CBT so they can assess your progress.
Medicine
"If you and your doctor think it might be helpful, you may be prescribed:"
""
"a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or, if SSRIs are not suitable, a tricyclic antidepressant (usually imipramine or clomipramine)"
"an anti-epilepsy medicine such as pregabalin or, if your anxiety is severe, clonazepam (these medicines are also beneficial for treating anxiety)"
"Antidepressants can take 2 to 4 weeks before they start to work, and up to 8 weeks to work fully."
"Keep taking your medicines, even if you feel they're not working, and only stop taking them if your GP advises you to do so."
Referral to a specialist
"If your symptoms do not improve after CBT, medicine and connecting with a support group, your GP may refer you to a mental health specialist such as a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist."
The specialist will carry out an assessment and devise a treatment plan to help you manage your symptoms.
Things you can try yourself
What to do during a panic attack
The next time you feel a panic attack coming on:
""
"stay where you are, if possible"
breathe slowly and deeply
remind yourself that the attack will pass
"focus on positive, peaceful and relaxing images"
remember it's not life threatening
Preventing a further attack
It may help to:
""
read a self-help book for anxiety based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) – ask your GP to recommend one
"try activities like yoga and pilates, to help you relax"
learn breathing exercises for stress to help ease symptoms
do regular physical exercise to reduce stress and tension
"avoid sugary food and drinks, caffeine and alcohol, and stop smoking, as they can all make attacks worse"
"For more help on how to deal with panic attacks, read about anxiety, fear and panic."

Complications of panic disorder
Panic disorder is treatable so it's best to get medical help as soon as you can.
"If you do not get medical help, panic disorder can escalate and become very difficult to cope with."
"You're more at risk of developing other mental health conditions, such as agoraphobia or other phobias, or an alcohol or drug problem."
Having panic disorder may affect your ability to drive.
The law requires you to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could impact your driving ability.
Visit GOV.UK for further information about driving with a disability or health condition.
Causes
"As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder is not fully understood."
"But it's thought to be linked to a combination of things, including:"
""
"a traumatic or very stressful life experience, such as bereavement"
having a close family member with panic disorder
an imbalance of neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) in the brain
Panic disorder in children
"If your child has the signs and symptoms of panic disorder, they should see a GP."
After taking a detailed medical history the GP will carry out a thorough physical examination to rule out any physical causes for the symptoms.
They may refer your child to a specialist for further assessment and treatment.
The specialist may recommend a course of CBT for your child.

"A person with a personality disorder thinks, feels, behaves or relates to others very differently from the average person."
There are several different types of personality disorder.
"This page gives some information about personality disorders in general, linking to other sources for more detail."
Symptoms of a personality disorder
Symptoms vary depending on the type of personality disorder.
"For example, a person with borderline personality disorder (one of the most common types) tends to have disturbed ways of thinking, impulsive behaviour and problems controlling their emotions."
They may have intense but unstable relationships and worry about people abandoning them.
A person with antisocial personality disorder will typically get easily frustrated and have difficulty controlling their anger.
"They may blame other people for problems in their life, and be aggressive and violent, upsetting others with their behaviour."
"Someone with a personality disorder may also have other mental health problems, such as depression and drug addiction."
Other types of personality disorder will have different symptoms.
Find out more about the different types of personality disorder on the Mind website
""
Information:
"Mild, moderate and severe personality disorders"
The way personality disorders are diagnosed is changing.
"Instead of being diagnosed with a type of personality disorder (such as borderline personality disorder), you may be diagnosed with mild, moderate or severe personality disorder."
A mental health professional can talk to you about what your diagnosis means.
Treatment for a personality disorder
Treatment for a personality disorder usually involves a talking therapy and can also include other types of therapy and medicine.
Talking therapies
"This is where the person talks to a therapist to get a better understanding of their own thoughts, feelings and behaviours."
"Treatment can last several months or years, depending on the severity of the condition and other problems the person may have."
"As well as listening and discussing important issues with the person, the therapist may identify strategies to resolve problems and, if necessary, help them change their attitudes and behaviour."
Therapeutic communities
Treatment at a therapeutic community may be offered to some people with personality disorders.
Therapeutic communities (TCs) are places where someone visits or stays for an intensive form of group therapy.
The experience of having a personality disorder is explored in depth.
The person usually attends for a number of weeks or months.
Medicine
"Medicine may be prescribed to treat problems associated with a personality disorder, such as depression, anxiety or psychotic symptoms."
"For example, moderate to severe symptoms of depression might be treated with a type of antidepressant called a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)."

Recovery
Many people with a personality disorder recover over time.
"Psychological or medical treatment is often helpful, but support is sometimes all that's needed."
There's no single approach that suits everyone – treatment should be tailored to the individual.
Causes
"It's not clear exactly what causes personality disorders, but they're thought to result from a combination of the genes a person inherits and early environmental influences – for example, a distressing childhood experience (such as abuse or neglect)."
"Pregnancy, becoming a parent and personality disorders"
"If you have a personality disorder, you may need extra support during your pregnancy and after your child is born."
"You can speak to a GP, midwife or health visitor if you would like support."

"A phobia is an overwhelming and debilitating fear of an object, place, situation, feeling or animal."
Phobias are more pronounced than fears.
They develop when a person has an exaggerated or unrealistic sense of danger about a situation or object.
"If a phobia becomes very severe, a person may organise their life around avoiding the thing that's causing them anxiety."
"As well as restricting their day-to-day life, it can also cause a lot of distress."
Phobia symptoms
A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder.
You may not experience any symptoms until you come into contact with the source of your phobia.
"But in some cases, even thinking about the source of a phobia can make a person feel anxious or panicky."
This is known as anticipatory anxiety.
Symptoms may include:
""
"unsteadiness, dizziness and lightheadedness"
nausea
sweating
increased heart rate or palpitations
shortness of breath
trembling or shaking
an upset stomach
"If you do not come into contact with the source of your phobia very often, it may not affect your everyday life."
"But if you have a complex phobia, such as agoraphobia, leading a normal life may be very difficult."
Types of phobia
There are a wide variety of objects or situations that someone could develop a phobia about.
But phobias can be divided into 2 main categories:
""
specific or simple phobias
complex phobias
Specific or simple phobias
"Specific or simple phobias centre around a particular object, animal, situation or activity."
They often develop during childhood or adolescence and may become less severe as you get older.
Common examples of simple phobias include:
""
"animal phobias – such as dogs, spiders, snakes or rodents"
"environmental phobias – such as heights, deep water and germs"
situational phobias – such as visiting the dentist or flying
"bodily phobias – such as blood, vomit or having injections"
sexual phobias – such as performance anxiety or the fear of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
Complex phobias
Complex phobias tend to be more disabling than simple phobias.
They usually develop during adulthood and are often associated with a deep-rooted fear or anxiety about a particular situation or circumstance.
The 2 most common complex phobias are:
""
agoraphobia
social phobia
"Agoraphobia is often thought of as a fear of open spaces, but it's much more complex than this."
Someone with agoraphobia will feel anxious about being in a place or situation where escaping may be difficult if they have a panic attack.
The anxiety usually results in the person avoiding situations such as:
""
being alone
"being in crowded places, such as busy restaurants or supermarkets"
travelling on public transport
"Social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder, centres around feeling anxious in social situations."
"If you have a social phobia, you might be afraid of speaking in front of people for fear of embarrassing yourself and being humiliated in public."
"In severe cases, this can become debilitating and may prevent you carrying out everyday activities, such as eating out or meeting friends."
What causes phobias?
"Phobias do not seem to have a single cause, but there are a number of associated factors."
For example:
""
a phobia may be associated with a particular incident or trauma
a phobia may be a learned response that a person develops early in life from a parent or sibling (brother or sister)
genetics may play a role – there's evidence to suggest that some people are born with a tendency to be more anxious than others
Diagnosing phobias
Phobias are not always formally diagnosed.
Most people with a phobia are fully aware of the problem.
"A person will sometimes choose to live with a phobia, taking great care to avoid the object or situation they're afraid of."
"But if you have a phobia, continually trying to avoid what you're afraid of could make the situation worse."
Ask a GP for help if you have a phobia.
"They may refer you to a specialist with expertise in behavioural therapy, such as a psychologist."
You can refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.
Find an NHS talking therapies service
Treating phobias
Most phobias can be treated successfully.
"Simple phobias can be treated through gradual exposure to the object, animal, place or situation that causes fear and anxiety."
This is known as desensitisation or self-exposure therapy.
You could try these methods with the help of a professional or as part of a self-help programme.
"Treating complex phobias often takes longer and involves talking therapies, such as:"
""
counselling
psychotherapy
cognitive behavioural therapy
Medication may be prescribed to help with anxiety caused by certain phobias.
Medicines that may be used include:
""
antidepressants
tranquillisers
beta blockers
How common are phobias?
Phobias are a common type of anxiety disorder.
"They can affect anyone, regardless of age, sex and social background."
Some of the most common phobias include:
""
arachnophobia – fear of spiders
claustrophobia – fear of confined spaces
agoraphobia – fear of open spaces and public places
social phobia – fear of social situations
""
Postnatal depression is a type of depression that many parents experience after having a baby.
"It's a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 women within a year of giving birth."
It can also affect fathers and partners.
"It's important to get help as soon as possible if you think you might be depressed, as your symptoms could last for months or get worse and have a significant impact on you, your baby and your family."
With the right support most people make a full recovery.
Symptoms of postnatal depression
"Many women feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth."
"This is often called the ""baby blues"" and is so common that it's considered normal."
"The ""baby blues"" do not last for more than 2 weeks after giving birth."
"If your symptoms last longer or start later, you could have postnatal depression."
Postnatal depression can start any time in the first year after giving birth.
Signs that you or someone you know might be depressed include:
""
a persistent feeling of sadness and low mood
lack of enjoyment and loss of interest in the wider world
lack of energy and feeling tired all the time
trouble sleeping at night and feeling sleepy during the day
finding it difficult to look after yourself and your baby
withdrawing from contact with other people
problems concentrating and making decisions
"frightening thoughts – for example, about hurting your baby"
Many women do not realise they have postnatal depression because it can develop gradually.
"Non-urgent advice:Speak to a GP, midwife or health visitor as soon as possible if:"
you think you may be depressed
Many midwives and health visitors have been trained to recognise postnatal depression and have techniques that can help.
Remember that:
""
"a range of help and support is available, including talking therapy"
depression is an illness like any other
it's not your fault you're depressed – it can happen to anyone
being depressed does not mean you're a bad parent
it does not mean you're going mad
your baby will not be taken away from you – babies are only taken into care in very exceptional circumstances
Treatments for postnatal depression
"Postnatal depression can be lonely, distressing and frightening, but support and effective treatments are available."
These include:
""
"self-help – things you can try yourself include talking to your family and friends about your feelings and what they can do to help, making time for yourself to do things you enjoy, resting whenever you get the chance, getting as much sleep as you can at night, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet"
"talking therapy – a GP may be able to recommend a self-help course or may refer you for a course of therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)"
antidepressants – these may be recommended if your depression is more severe or other treatments have not helped; your doctor can prescribe a medicine that's safe to take while breastfeeding
"Local and national organisations, such as the Association for Post Natal Illness (APNI) and Pre and Postnatal Depression Advice and Support (PANDAS), can also be useful sources of help and advice."
Causes of postnatal depression
The cause of postnatal depression is not completely clear.
There are a number of things that may make you more likely to have postnatal depression.
These include:
""
"a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life"
a history of mental health problems during pregnancy
having no close family or friends to support you
a difficult relationship with your partner
"recent stressful life events, such as a bereavement"
"physical or psychological trauma, such as domestic violence"
"Even if you do not have any of these, having a baby is a life-changing event that can sometimes trigger depression."
It often takes time to adapt to becoming a new parent.
Looking after a baby can be stressful and exhausting.
Preventing postnatal depression
"There are things you can do during pregnancy to help you keep well, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and having someone you can talk to and turn to for support."
Going to antenatal classes and making friends with other pregnant women or new parents can also be helpful.
"If you are pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant, talk to a GP or your mental health team if:"
""
you have a history of depression or mental health problems
"someone in your family has had mental health problems after childbirth (for example, your mother or sister)"
This is so they can offer you appropriate treatment.
"You can also talk to a midwife, who can support you or refer you to specialist mental health services if needed."
"If you have had a mental health problem while pregnant, your doctor should arrange for you to be seen regularly in the first few weeks after birth."
"The mental health team, maternity team and GP will work closely with you during your pregnancy and after you have given birth."
Myths about postnatal depression
Postnatal depression is often misunderstood and there are many myths surrounding it.
These include:
""
"postnatal depression is less severe than other types of depression – in fact, it's as serious as other types of depression"
postnatal depression is entirely caused by hormonal changes – it's actually caused by many different factors
"postnatal depression will soon pass – unlike the ""baby blues"", postnatal depression can persist for months if left untreated and in a minority of cases it can become a long-term problem"
postnatal depression only affects women – research has actually found that up to 1 in 10 new fathers become depressed after having a baby
These factors are equally true of antenatal depression.
